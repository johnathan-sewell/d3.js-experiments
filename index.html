        "(Cheers, applause.)\nJOSEPH BIDEN: Hey, Delaware. (Cheers, applause.) Hello, my fellow Democrats. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd my favorite Democrat, Jilly, I want you to know that Beau and Hunt and Ashley and I â€” we're so incredibly proud of you, kid. You know, we admire the way â€” they way that when every single solitary young person â€” and they're not all young â€” walk into your classroom, you not only teach them, you give them confidence.\nYou give me confidence. And the passion â€” the passion she brings to trying to ease the burden on the families of our warriers. Jilly, they know you understand them. And that makes a gigantic difference. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd folks, I tell you what, it was worth the trip to hear my wife say what I've never heard her say before: She's always loved me. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) If that's the case, why in the heck did it take five times of asking you? And that's true. Five times. I don't know what I would have done, kiddo, had you on that fifth time said no. (Laughter.) I love you. You're the love of my life and the life of my love. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe've got three incredible kids. And Beau, I want to thank you for putting my name in nomination to be vice president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.) I accept. (Sustained cheers, applause.) I accept. With great honor and pleasure, I accept. Thank you. Thank you, my fellow Democrats. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you, my fellow Democrats. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd I say to my fellow Americans: My fellow Americans, four years ago a battered nation turned away from the failed policies of the past and turned to a leader who they knew would lift our nation out of the crisis â€” a journey â€” a journey we haven't finished yet. We know we still have more to do. But today I say to my fellow citizens: In the face of the deepest economic crisis in our lifetime, this generation of Americans has proven itself as worthy as any generation before us. (Cheers, applause.) For we present that same grit, that same determination, that same courage that has always defined what it means to be an American, has always defined all of you. Together we're on a mission. We're on a mission to move this nation forward from doubt and downturn to promise and prosperity, a mission I guarantee you we will complete â€” (cheers, applause) â€” a mission we will complete.\nFolks, tonight what I really want to do is tell you about my friend Barack Obama. (Cheers, applause.) No one could tell it as well or as eloquently as Michelle â€” as you did last night, Michelle â€” Monday night. (Cheers, applause.) But I know him, to state the obvious, from a different perspective.\nI know him, and I want to show you â€” I want to show you the character of a leader who had what it took when the American people literally stood on the brink of a new depression, a leader who has what it takes to lead us over the next four years to a future as great as our people. I want to take you inside the White House to see the president as I see him every day, because I don't see him in soundbites. I walk 30 paces down the hall into the Oval Office, and I see him, I watch him in action.\nFour years ago the middle class was already losing ground, and then the bottom fell out. The financial crisis hit like a sledgehammer on all the people I grew up with. You remember the headlines. You saw some of them in the previews. Highlight: Highest job losses in 60 years. Headlines: Economy on the brink; markets plummet worldwide.\nFrom the very moment President Obama sat behind the desk, resolute, in the Oval Office, he knew â€” he knew he had not only to restore the confidence of a nation, but he had to restore the confidence of the whole world. (Cheers, applause.) And he also knew â€” he also knew that one, one false move could bring a run on the banks or a credit collapse to put another several million people out of work. America and the world needed a strong president with a steady hand and with the judgment and vision to see us through.\nDay after day, night after night I sat beside him as he made one gutsy decision after the other to stop the slide and reverse it. I watched him. (Applause.) I watched him stand up. I watched him stand up to intense pressure and stare down enormous, enormous challenges, the consequences of which were awesome.\nBut most of all, I got to see firsthand what drove this man: his profound concern for the average American. He knew â€” he knew that no matter how tough the decisions he had to make were in that Oval Office, he knew that families all over America sitting at their kitchen tables were literally making decisions for their family that were equally as consequential.\nYou know, Barack and I, we've been through a lot together these four years, and we learned about one another, a lot about one another. And one of the things I learned about Barack is the enormity of his heart. And I think he learned about me the depth of my loyalty to him. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd there's another thing, another thing that has bound us together these past four years. We had a pretty good idea what all those families, all you Americans in trouble were going through, in part because our own families had gone through similar struggles.\nBarack as a young man had to sit at the end of his mother's hospital bed and watch her fight with her insurance company at the very same time she was fighting for her life.\nWhen I was a young kid in third grade, I remember my dad coming up the stairs in my grandpop's house where we were living, sitting at the end of my bed, and saying, Joey, I'm going to have to leave for a while. Gone â€” go down to Wilmington, Delaware, with Uncle Franks. They're good jobs down there, honey. And in a little while â€” a little while, I'll be able to send for you and mom and Jimmy and Val, and everything's going to be fine.\nFor the rest of our life, my sister and my brothers, for the rest of our life, dad never failed to remind us that a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about â€” (applause) â€” it's about your dignity. (Cheers, applause.) It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about being able to look your child in the eye and say, honey, it's going to be OK, and mean it, and know it's true. (Cheers, applause.)\nWhen Barack and I â€” when Barack and I were growing up, there was an implicit understanding in America that if you took responsibility, you'd get a fair shot at a better life. And the values â€” the values behind that bargain were the values that shaped both of us, and many, many of you. And today those same values are Barack's guiding star. Folks, I've watched him. He has never wavered.\nHe never, never backs down. He always steps up, and he always asks in every one of those critical meetings the same fundamental question: How is this going to affect the average American? How is this going to affect people's lives? (Cheers, applause.) That's what's inside this man. That's what makes him tick. That's who he is.\nAnd folks, because of the decisions he has made, and the incredible strength of the American people, America has turned a corner. The worst job loss since the Great Depression, we've since created 4.5 million private sector jobs in the past 25 â€” 29 months. (Cheers, applause.)\nLook, folks. President Obama and Governor Romney, they're both â€” they're both loving husbands. They're both devoted fathers. But let's be straight. They bring a vastly different vision and a vastly different values set to the job. (Applause.)\nAnd tonight â€” tonight, although you've heard people talk about it, I want to talk about two things from a slightly different perspective, from my perspective. I'd like to focus on two crises and show you â€” show you the character of leadership that each man will bring to this job, because as I said, I've had a ringside seat. The first of these a lot's been talked about.\nAnd God love Jennifer Granholm. Wasn't she great? (Cheers, applause.) Wasn't she great? I love Jennifer. (Cheers, applause.)\nBut the first story I want to talk to you about is the rescue of the automobile industry. And let me tell you â€” let me tell you â€” from this man's ringside seat, let me tell you about how Barack Obama saved more than a million American jobs. In the first â€” in the first days, literally the first days that we took office, General Motors and Chrysler were literally on the verge of liquidation. If the president didn't act, if he didn't act immediately, there wouldn't be any industry left to save.\nSo we sat hour after hour in the Oval Office. Michelle remembers how it must have â€” what he must have thought when she â€” he came back upstairs. We sat. We sat hour after hour. We listened to senators, congressmen, outside advisers, even some of our own adviser (sic), and we listened to them to say some of the following things. They said, well, we shouldn't step up. The risk â€” the risk was too high. The outcome was too uncertain.\nAnd the president, he patiently sat there and he listened. But he didn't see it the way they did. He understood something they didn't get. And one of the reasons I love him, he understood that this wasn't just about cars. It was about the people who built and made those cars â€” (cheers, applause) â€” and about the America those people build. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn those meetings â€” (cheers, applause) â€” in those meetings â€” in those meetings, I often thought about my dad. My dad was an automobile man. He would have been one of those guys all the way down the line, not on the factory floor, not along the supply chain, but one of those guys who were selling American cars to American people.\nI thought about â€” I thought about what this crisis would have meant for the mechanics and the secretaries and the salespeople who my dad managed for over 35 years. And I know for certain â€” I know for certain that my dad, were he here today, he'd be fighting like heck for the president, because the president fought to save the jobs of those people my dad cared so much about. (Applause.) Ladies and gentlemen, my dad â€” (applause) â€” my dad respected Barack Obama â€” would have respected Barack Obama, had he been around, for having had the guts to stand up for the automobile industry when so many others just were prepared to walk away.\nYou know, when I look back â€” (applause) â€” when I look back now, when I look back on the president's decision, I think of another son of another automobile man, Mitt Romney. Mitt â€” no, no â€” Mitt Romney â€” Mitt Romney grew up in Detroit. My dad managed, his dad owned â€” well, his dad ran an entire automobile company, American Motors. Yes, what I don't understand is in spite of that, he was willing to let the â€” Detroit go bankrupt.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Boo!\nJOSEPH BIDEN: No, don't. I don't think he's a bad guy. No, no. I don't think he's a bad guy. I'm sure he grew up loving cars as much as I did. But what I don't understand, what I don't think he understood, I don't think he understood that saving the automobile worker, saving the industry, what it meant to all of America, not just autoworkers. I think he saw it the Bain way. Now, I mean this sincerely. I think he saw it in terms of balance sheets and write-offs.\nFolks, the Bain way may bring your firm the highest profits. But it's not the way to lead our country from the highest office. (Extended cheers, applause.)\nWhen things â€” when things â€” when things hung in the balance â€” when things hung in the balance â€” I mean, literally hung in the balance â€” the president understood this was about a lot more than the automobile industry. This was about restoring America's pride. He understood â€” he understood in his gut what it would mean to leave a million people without hope or work if he didn't act. And he also knew â€” he also knew â€” he intuitively understood the message it would have sent around the world if the United States gave up on an industry that helped put America on the map in the first place. (Cheers, applause.) Conviction, resolve, Barack Obama â€” that's what saved the automobile industry. (Cheers, applause.) Conviction, resolve, Barack Obama. (Cheers, applause.)\nLook, you heard my friend John Kerry. This president â€” this president has shown the same resolve, the same steady hand in his role as commander in chief. (Applause.) Look â€” which brings me to the next illustration I want to tell you about, the next crisis he had to face. In 2008 â€” 2008, before he was president â€” Barack Obama made a promise to the American people.\nHe said, if I have bin â€” if we have bin Laden in our sights, we will â€” we will take him out. (Cheers, applause.)\nHe went on to say â€” he went on to say, that has to be our biggest national security priority.\nLook, Barack understood that the search for bin Laden was about a lot more than taking a monstrous leader off the battlefield. It was about so much more than that. It was about righting an unspeakable wrong. It was about â€” literally, it was about â€” it was about healing an unbearable wound, a nearly unbearable wound in America's heart.\nAnd he also knew â€” he also knew the message we had to send around the world: If you attack innocent Americans, we will follow you to the end of the earth. (Cheers, applause.)\nLook â€”\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!\nJOSEPH BIDEN: Most of all â€” most of all, President Obama had an unyielding faith in the capacity and the capability of our special forces, literally the finest warriors in the history of the world. (Cheers, applause.) The finest warriors in the history of the world.\nSo we sat. (Cheers, applause.) We sat originally â€” only five of us â€” we sat in the Situation Room beginning in the fall of the year before. We listened, we talked, we heard, and he listened to the risks and reservations about the raid. He asked again the tough questions. He listened to the doubts that were expressed.\nBut when Admiral McRaven looked him in the eye and said, sir, we can get this job done, I sat next to him and looked at your husband, and I knew at that moment he had made his decision. And his response was decisive. He said, do it â€” and justice was done! (Cheers, applause.)\nFolks, folks â€”\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!\nJOSEPH BIDEN: Folks, Governor Romney didn't see things that way. When he was asked about bin Laden in 2007, here's what he said. He said, it's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just to catch one person. (Boos.)\nBut he was wrong. He was wrong. Because if you understood that America's heart had to be healed, you would have done exactly what the president did and you would move heaven and earth to hunt him down and to bring him to justice. (Cheers, applause.)\nLook, four years ago â€” four years ago â€” the only thing missing at this convention this year is my mom. Four years ago my mom was still with us, sitting up in the stadium in Denver. I quoted her.\n(Cheers, applause.) I quoted her, one of her favorite expressions. She used to say to all her children â€” she said, Joey, bravery resides in every heart, and the time will come when it must be summoned.\nLadies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you what I think you already know. But I watch it up close. Bravery resides in the heart of Barack Obama, and time and time again I witnessed him summon it. (Applause.) This man has courage in his soul, compassion in his heart and a spine of steel. (Cheers, applause.) And â€” and because â€” because of all the actions he took, because of the calls he made, because of the determination of American workers and the unparalleled bravery of our special forces, we can now proudly say what you've heard me say the last six months: Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive. (Cheers, applause.) That's right. One man.\nFolks, we know â€” we know we have more work to do. We know we're not there yet. But not a day has gone by in the last four years when I haven't been grateful as an American that Barack Obama is our president because he always has the courage to make the tough decisions. (Cheers, applause.)\nSpeaking of tough decisions â€” speaking of tough calls â€” (chuckles) â€” last week we heard at the Republican convention â€” we heard our opponents â€” we heard them pledge that they too â€” they too heard the courage to make the tough calls.\nThat's what they said. (Laughter.)\nBut folks, in case you didn't notice â€” (laughter) â€” and I say to my fellow Americans, in case you didn't notice, they didn't have the courage to tell you what calls they'd make. (Laughter, applause.) They never mentioned any of that. (Applause.)\nThey â€” Mrs. Robinson, you â€” you watched from home, I guess, from the White House. You heard them talk so much about how they cared so much about Medicare, how much they wanted to preserve it. That's what they told you.\nBut let's look at what they didn't tell you. What they didn't tell you is that the plan they have already put down on paper would immediately cut benefits for more than 30 million seniors already on Medicare. What they didn't tell you â€” what they didn't tell you is the plan they're proposing would cause Medicare to go bankrupt by 2016. And what they really didn't tell you is they â€” if you want to know â€” if you want to know â€” they're not for preserving Medicare at all. They're for a new plan. It's called \"Vouchercare.\" (Boos.)\nLook, folks. That's not courage. That's not even truthful. That's not even truthful. In Tampa, they talk with great urgency about the nation's debt and the need to act, to act now. But not once, not one single time, did they tell you that they rejected every plan put forward by us, by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission they referenced â€” (applause) â€” or by any other respected group to reduce the national debt.\nThey are not for any of them. Why? Because they're not prepared to do anything about the debt if it contained even one dollar â€” I'm not exaggerating â€” even one dollar or one cent in new taxes for millionaires.\nFolks, that's not courage and that's not fair. (Applause.)\nLook â€” look. In a sense, this can be reduced to a single notion. The two men seeking to lead this country over the next four years, as I said at the outset, have fundamentally different visions and a completely different value set.\nGovernor Romney believes in this global economy â€” it doesn't matter much where American companies invest and put their money or where they create jobs. As a matter of fact, in his budget proposal, in his tax proposal, he calls for a new tax. It's called a territorial tax, which the experts have looked at, and they acknowledge it will create 800,000 new jobs â€” all of them overseas, all of them. (Boos.)\nAnd what I've found â€” what I found fascinating, the most fascinating thing I found last week was when Governor Romney said that as president, he would take a jobs tour. Well, with his support for outsourcing, it's going to have to be a foreign trip. (Cheers, applause.) It will.\nLook, President Obama knows that creating jobs in America, keeping jobs in America, bringing jobs back to America is what the president's job was all about.\nThat's what presidents do, or at least supposed to do. (Applause.)\nFolks, Governor Romney believes it's OK to raise taxes on middle classes by $2,000 in order to pay for another â€” literally another trillion-dollar tax cut for the very wealthy. President Obama knows that there's nothing decent or fair about asking people with more to do less and with less to do more. (Scattered cheers.)\nGovernor Romney believes â€” he believes that kids, kids like our \"DREAMers\" â€” those immigrant children â€” (cheers, applause) â€” those immigrant children who were brought to America's shores through no fault of their own â€” he thinks they're a drag on the American economy. President Obama believes that even though those \"DREAMers,\" those kids, didn't choose to come here, they have chosen to do right by America. And it's time for us to do right by them. (Extended cheers, applause.)\nGovernor Romney â€” Governor Romney â€” Governor Romney â€” Governor Romney looks at the notion of equal pay in terms of a company's bottom line. President Obama â€” he knows that making sure our daughters get the same pay for the same jobs as our son is every father's bottom line. (Cheers, applause.)\nLook, I kind of expected all that from him. But one thing truly perplexed me at their convention. The thing that perplexed me most was this idea they kept talking about about the culture of dependency. They seem to think you create a culture of dependency when you provide a bright, young, qualified kid from a working-class family a loan to get to college or when you provide a job training program in a new industry for a dad who lost his job because it was outsourced.\nFolks â€” folks, that's not how we look at it. That's not how America's ever looked at it. (Applause.) What he doesn't understand is all these men and women are looking for is a chance, just a chance to acquire the skills to be able to provide for their families so they can once again hold their heads high and lead independent lives with dignity. That's all they're looking for. (Cheers, applause.)\nLook â€” and it literally amazes me they don't understand that. You know, I told you the outset the choice is stark, two different visions, two different value sets. But at its core, the difference is able to reduced (sic) to be a fundamental difference. You see, you, we, most Americans have incredible faith in the decency and hard work of the American people. And we know what has made this country. It's the American people. (Cheers, applause.)\nAs I mentioned at the outset, four years ago we were hit hard. You saw â€” you saw your retirement accounts drain, the equity in your homes vanish, jobs lost around the line. But what did you do as Americans? What you've always done. You didn't lose faith. You fought back. You didn't give up; you got up. (Cheers, applause.) You're the ones, the American people, you're the ones. You're the reason why we are still better-positioned than any country in the world to lead the 21st century. (Cheers, applause.) You never quit on America. And you deserve a president who will never quit on you. (Cheers, applause.)\nFolks, there's one more thing, one more thing our Republican opponents are just dead wrong about. America is not in decline. America is not in decline. (Applause.) I've got news for Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan: Gentlemen, never ever â€” it never makes sense, it's never been a good bet to bet against the American people. (Cheers, applause.) Never!\nMy fellow Americans, America is coming back. And we're not going back. And we have no intention of downsizing the American dream. (Extended cheers, applause.) Never. Never a good bet.\nLadies and gentlemen, in a moment â€” in a moment we're going to hear from a man whose whole life is a testament to the power of that dream and whose presidency is the best hope to secure that dream for our children. For you see â€” you see, we see a future â€” we really honest to God do â€” we see a future where everyone, rich and poor, does their part and has a part, a future where we depend more on clean energy from home and less on oil from abroad, a future where we're number one in the world again in college graduation, a future where we promote the private sector, not the privileged sector â€” (cheers, applause) â€” and a future â€” and a future where women once again control their own choices, their destiny and their own health care. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, Barack and I see a future â€” it's in our DNA â€” where no one, no one is forced to live in the shadows of intolerance. (Cheers, applause.)\nFolks, we see a future where American â€” where America leads not only by the power of our â€” the example of our power, but by the power of example, where we bring our troops home from Afghanistan just as we proudly did from Iraq â€” (cheers, applause) â€” a future â€” a future where we fulfill the only truly sacred obligation we have as a nation. The only truly sacred obligation we have is to prepare those who we send to war and care for them when they come home from war.\nAnd tonight â€” (applause) â€” and tonight â€” tonight I want to acknowledge â€” I want to acknowledge, as we should every night, the incredible debt we owe to the families of those 6,473 fallen angels and those 49,746 wounded, thousands critically, thousands who will need our help for the rest of their lives.\nFolks, we never â€” we must never, ever forget their sacrifice and always keep them in our care and in our prayers.\nMy fellow Americans, we now â€” we now â€” and we now find ourselves at the hinge of history. And the direction we turn is not figuratively, is literally in your hands. It has been a truly great honor to serve you and to serve with Barack, who has always stood up with you for the past four years. I've seen him tested. I know his strength, his command, his faith. And I also know the incredible confidence he has in all of you. I know this man. Yes, the work of recovery is not yet â€” not yet complete. But we are on our way. The journey of hope is not yet finished, but we are on our way. (Applause.) And the cause of change is not fully accomplished, but we are on our way. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo I say to you tonight with absolute confidence, America's best days are ahead, and yes, we are on our way. (Cheers, applause.) And in light â€” in light of that horizon, for the values that define us, for the ideals that inspire us, there is only one choice. That choice is to move forward, boldly forward, and finish the job ahank you!",
        "ANGIE FLORES: My name is Angie Flores and I am a student at Miami-Dade College. (Cheers, applause.)\nWhen you grow up in a family where getting by is a struggle, college can seem like a dream for someone else, even if, like me, you love learning. Out of 3.2 million young people ages 16 to 24, 2.2 million do not go to college. More than a million don't even graduate from high school.\nThe statistics say that I shouldn't be here; that the most someone like me should hope for is to get by, not to get ahead.\nBut I am not a statistic. (Cheers, applause.) I am a young woman with a bright future.\nPresident Obama and Vice President Biden know this. They don't want any American student to accept that education is only a luxury or that opportunity is simply for someone else. They ask us to work hard and dream big. And they work alongside us to make sure that those dreams come true. We all aspire to live that ideal middle-class lifestyle with the picket fence and the lemonade on the porch. And President Obama and Vice President Biden are helping kids like me build that dream. We all celebrate success. President Obama and Vice President Biden help us achieve it. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe all know that education leads to opportunity and that education begins with a great teacher in every classroom. Tonight I have the honor of introducing an extraordinary educator. A lot of people know Dr. Jill Biden as our nation's second lady. (Cheers, applause.) But she has an even more important title: She's a teacher. Even when her husband â€” (cheers, applause) â€” even when her husband got a pretty big promotion â€” (laughter) â€” she continued to educate. That's how strong her commitment is to her students. This amazing woman grades papers in the White House. (Applause.)\nLast year I had the distinct pleasure to meet Dr. Biden. I am fortunate to have teachers like her at Miami Dade College. She is full of warmth, compassion and dedication. And that's how she makes a difference for students like me.\nA teacher like Dr. Biden can make the difference between being a statistic and being a success, between getting by and getting ahead. (Applause.) And that is why â€” and that is why I am studying to work with children. When I look at Dr. Jill Biden, I see someone making the kinds of impact that I want to make.\nSo please join me in welcoming my role model, Dr. Jill Biden. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nJOHN NATHMAN: Today and every day, our military men and women serve our country with their actions and their deeds. The veterans standing with me â€” all veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan â€” are part of a proud legacy.\nFor those who defended us in the earliest days of our country to the greatest generation of World War II, for those who served and sacrificed in Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, the Balkans, anywhere they've been needed, today's servicemen and women have been called \"the next great generation,\" and they live up to that calling in everything they do. They've gone beyond the call of duty in every way one can imagine.\nI served the United States Navy for 37 years as a fighter pilot, as commander of Naval Air Forces and as vice chief of the Navy. I've heard plenty of folks thank us for our service. We appreciate that gratitude. And since the day he took office, the president has demonstrate that he respects and understands the challenges for those who wear a uniform.\nFor every branch of the service, for those in civilian clothes or the uniform, President Obama gives us a foreign policy worthy of the men and women on this stage â€” (cheers, applause) â€” to ensure â€” to ensure that wherever they serve, their uniform and dedication is respected and that their service makes a difference for America.\nFor every veteran who comes home wounded, the president invested in the VA and expanded care to more than a half-million returning troops who deserve that care. (Applause.) For every family waiting at home, anxious every time the phone rings, the president, the first lady and Dr. Jill Biden are engaging whole communities to support those families. For every man and woman coming back to an uncertain future, the president strives to help veterans apply their talents, expand their skills and get good jobs.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nLast year he challenged American businesses to hire 100,000 veterans and military spouses. He and the first lady got businesses across the private sector to sign on, supported by tax credits for hiring our veterans and wounded warriors. Last month these same participating businesses reported that they exceeded that goal by 25 percent, ahead of schedule by almost a year â€” (cheers, applause) â€” and they're committing to bring on a quarter-million more new veteran jobs. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd it's just â€” and it's not just about finding new jobs. It's about giving these men and women the chance to learn the skills for the jobs tomorrow. That's why I'm proud that the president is offering veterans the best education benefits since the original GI Bill. (Cheers, applause.) This education is something that can and will change their lives. And it guarantees American progress, vitality and growth. (Applause.)\nMy parents â€” my parents were members of the greatest generation. My dad joined the Army Air Corps in 1940 as an enlisted man fixing bombers in World War II. He served a career in the Strategic Air Command. My mother was a volunteer for the USO, and later, as a widow, she raised five children.\nIn the years since, I've been privileged to lead and serve with members of this next great generation. I see in them tough, bright, courageous, inspiring men and women. I see this country's future leaders. These service members have been to some of the bleakest corners of the globe. They know how good this country is. They know firsthand what America means to â€” world â€” they're â€” and they're going to bring to us the next great moment in our nation's history because the president is standing with them. (Cheers, applause.)\nTonight we are standing here with you. We are standing with our president. The men and women on this stage are only a small sample of this amazing generation â€” Americans from Texas â€” (cheers, applause) â€” from Virginia, from Florida, from Oregon, Maine, New York, Hawaii, North Carolina, all across this great country. And so for them â€” and so for them, they â€” and what they represent, please stand with me in saying thank you. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA! USA!",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nJOHN KERRY: Thank you. Thank you.\nIn this â€” in this campaign, we have a fundamental choice. Will we protect our country and our allies, advance our interests and ideals, do battle where we must and make peace where we can, or will we entrust our place in the world to someone who just hasn't learned the lessons of the last decade?\nWe've all learned Mitt Romney doesn't know much about foreign policy, but he has all these neocon advisers who know all the wrong things about foreign policy. He would rely on them. After all, he's the great outsourcer. (Laughter.)\nBut I say to you, this is not the time to outsource the job of commander in chief. (Cheers, applause.) Our opponents â€” our opponents like to talk about American exceptionalism, but all they do is talk.\nThey forget that we are exceptional not because we say we are but because we do exceptional things. (Cheers, applause.) We break out of the Great Depression, win two world wars, save lives fighting AIDS, pull people out of poverty, defend freedom, go to the moon and produce exceptional people who even give their lives for civil rights and for human rights. (Cheers, applause.)\nDespite â€” and despite â€” and despite what you heard in Tampa, an exceptional country does care about the rise of the oceans and the future of the planet. (Cheers, applause.) That is a responsibility â€” that is a responsibility from the Scriptures. And that too is a responsibility of the leader of the free world.\nThe only thing exceptional about today's Republicans is that almost without exception, they oppose everything that has made America exceptional in the first place. An exceptional nation demands exceptional leadership. It demands the leadership of an exceptional president. And my fellow Americans, that president is Barack Obama. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, just measure the disaster and disarray that he inherited. A war of choice in Iraq had become a war without end, and a war of necessity in Afghanistan had become a war of neglect. Our alliances were shredded. Our moral authority was in tatters. America was isolated in the world. Our military was stretched to the breaking point, Iran marching towards a nuclear weapon unchecked, and Osama bin Laden was still plotting.\nIt took President Obama to make America lead like America again.\n(Cheers, applause.) It took President Obama to restore our moral authority. It took President Obama to ban torture. The president understands that our values don't limit our power; they magnify it. He showed that global leadership is a strategic imperative for America, not a favor that we do to other countries.\nAnd President Obama kept his promises. He promised to end the war in Iraq, and he has, and our heroes have come home. (Cheers, applause.) He promised to end the war in Afghanistan responsibly, and he is, and our heroes are coming home. (Cheers, applause.) He promised to focus like a laser on al-Qaida, and he has. And our forces have eliminated more of its leadership in the last three years than in all the eight years that came before. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd after more than â€” after more than 10 years without justice for thousands of Americans murdered on 9/11, after Mitt Romney said it would be naive to go into Pakistan to pursue the terrorists, it took President Obama, against the advice of many, to give that order and finally rid this earth of Osama bin Laden. (Cheers, applause.) Ask Osama bin Laden if he is better off now than he was four years ago. (Cheers, applause.)\nBarack Obama â€” Barack Obama promised always to stand with Israel, to tighten sanctions on Iran and take nothing off the table.\nAgain and again, the other side has lied about where this president stands and what this president has done. But Prime Minister Netanyahu set the record straight. He said, our two countries have exactly the same policy; our security cooperation is unprecedented. And when it comes to Israel, my friends, I'll take the word of Israel's prime minister over Mitt Romney any day. (Cheers, applause.)\nPresident Obama promised to work with Russia to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons and signed an historic treaty that does just that. He promised to lock down nuclear materials around the world, and he has done just that. He refused to accept the false choice between force without diplomacy and diplomacy without force. When a brutal dictator promised to hunt down and kill his own people like rats, President Obama enlisted our allies, built the coalition, shared the burden so that today, without a single American casualty, Moammar Gadhafi is gone, and the people of Libya are free. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo on one side â€” so on one side of this campaign, we have a president who has made America lead like America again. And what is there on the other side? An extreme and expedient candidate who lacks the judgment and the vision so vital to the Oval Office, the most inexperienced foreign policy twosome to run for president and vice president in decades.\n(Cheers, applause.) You know, it isn't â€” it isn't fair to say that Mitt Romney doesn't have a position on Afghanistan. He has every position. (Laughter.)\nHe was against setting a date for withdrawal. Then he said it was right. And then he left the impression that maybe it was wrong to leave this soon. He said it was tragic to leave Iraq. And then he said it was fine. He said we should have intervened in Libya sooner. Then he ran down a hallway to run away from the reporters who were asking questions. Then he said the intervention was too aggressive. And then he said the world was a better place because the intervention succeeded.\nTalk about being for it before you were against it! (Cheers, applause.)\nMr. Romney â€” Mr. Romney â€” Mr. Romney, here's a little advice. Before you debate Barack Obama on foreign policy, you better finish the debate with yourself. (Sustained cheers, applause.)\nNow with President Mitt Romney â€” President Mitt Romney â€” (boos) â€” three very hypothetical words that mystified and alienated our allies this summer. (Laughter.) For Mitt Romney, an overseas trip is what you call it when you trip all over yourself overseas. (Laughter, cheers, applause.)\nYou know, it wasn't â€” it wasn't a goodwill mission, it was a blooper reel. (Cheers, applause.)\nBut a Romney-Ryan foreign policy would be anything but funny.\nEvery president of both parties for 60 years has worked for nuclear arms control, but not Mitt Romney. Republican secretaries of state, from Kissinger to Baker, Powell to Rice, President Bush, 71 United States senators all supported President Obama's New START treaty, but not Mitt Romney.\nHe's even blurted out the preposterous notion that Russia is our number-one political â€” geopolitical foe. Folks, Sarah Palin said she could see Russia from Alaska. (Laughter.) Mitt Romney talks like he's only seen Russia by watching \"Rocky IV\"!\nI'll tell you, so here's the choice â€” here's the choice in 2012. Mitt Romney, out of touch at home, out of his depth abroad and out of the mainstream, or Barack Obama, a president who is giving new life and truth to America's indispensable role in the world â€” a commander in chief who gives our troops the tools and training they need in war, the honor and help they have earned when they come home, a man â€” (cheers, applause) â€” a man â€” a man who will never ask other men and women to fight a war without a plan to win the peace. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd let me say â€” let me say something else. Let me say something else. No nominee for president should ever fail in the midst of a war to pay tribute to our troops overseas in his acceptance speech. (Cheers, applause.) Mitt Romney â€” Mitt Romney was talking about America.\nThey are on the front lines every day defending America, and they deserve our thanks. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA! USA!\nJOHN KERRY: Some of us â€” some of us â€” some of us from a prior war remember coming home was not always easy. President Obama has made it his mission that we welcome our troops home with care and concern and the respect they deserve. That is how an exceptional nation says thank you to its most exceptional men and women. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt Romney says he believes in America and that he will restore American exceptionalism. I have news for him: We already have an exceptional American as president, and we believe in Barack Obama. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you, and God bless America. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "CHARLIE CRIST: Good evening. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. (Cheers, applause.) What an incredible night. Optimism is in the air, and what an honor to be here with you to stand with President Barack Obama. (Cheers, applause.)\nHalf a century ago, Ronald Reagan, the man whose optimism was inspiring to me to enter politics â€” he famously said at one time that he did not leave the Democratic Party, but the party left him. Well, listen, I can relate. (Laughter.) I didn't leave the Republican Party; it left me. (Cheers, applause.) Then again, my friend Jeb Bush recently noted, Reagan himself would have been too moderate, too reasonable for today's GOP.\nWe face serious challenges in our country. We must create good middle-class jobs so we can have an economy that is built to last. We must rebuild our roads and bridges and improve our public schools. And particularly important to me and my state of Florida is the challenge of saving Medicare and Social Security so we can keep our promise to our seniors. (Cheers, applause.)\nBut there are common-sense solutions within our reach, if we only have leaders who are willing and enthusiastic to find common ground.\nNo political party has the monopoly on that kind of leadership, but as a former lifelong Republican, it pains me to tell you that today's Republicans and their standard-bearers Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan just aren't up to the task. (Cheers, applause.) They're beholden to the \"my way or the highway\" bullies, indebted to billionaires who bankroll their ads, and allergic to the very idea of compromise. (Applause.) Ronald Reagan would not have stood for that. Barack Obama does not stand for that. You and I will not stand for that. (Cheers, applause.)\nI'll be honest with you. I don't agree with President Obama about everything, but I've gotten to know him, and I've worked with him. And the choice is crystal clear. When he took office, the economic crisis had already put my state of Florida on the edge of disaster. The foreclosure crisis was consuming homeowners, the tourists we depend on couldn't visit and our vital construction industry had come to a standstill. President Obama saw what I saw â€” a catastrophe in the making â€” and he took action. (Cheers, applause.)\nOne of his first trips in office brought him to Fort Myers, Florida, where I was proud to embrace him and his plan to keep our teachers, police and firefighters on the job. (Cheers, applause.) Well, that hug caused me more grief from my party than you can ever imagine. But even as the Republican Party fought tooth and nail to stop him, this president showed his courage, invested in America and saved our Florida.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nTwo years later Florida and the Gulf Coast faced the worst environmental disaster in our nation's history, this time when a ruptured well spilled nearly 5 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. President Obama came to our rescue again, leading a massive cleanup effort and demanding accountability from those responsible. (Cheers, applause.) My friends, he didn't see a red state. He didn't see a blue state. He simply saw Americans who needed help. And once again â€” once again I saw the leader our country needs. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know, I used to play quarterback just down the road from here at Wake Forest University. And my dad always â€” (cheers) â€” go Deacons! And my dad always told me, he said, Charlie, it takes a cool head to win a hot game. My friends, our country is in the middle of a hot game. And we face serious challenges both at home and abroad. Meanwhile, our politics are defined by discord and discontent. Never has it been harder for a president to keep a cool head, and never has it been more important.\nI look around Florida. I see a state bursting with diversity and opportunity, a state that looks like America's future. When I look at the Republican ticket today, I see two candidates who would break the fundamental promise of Medicare and Social Security and cut investments on our middle class that are so important to our recovery.\nAnd then I look at Barack Obama. I see a leader with a cool head, a caring heart and an open mind, a president who has demonstrated through his demeanor, his grace and his deeds that he is uniquely qualified to heal our divisions, rebuild our nation and lead us to a brighter future.\nThat's the leader Florida needs. That's the leader America needs. That's the reason I'm here tonight, not as a Republican, not as a Democrat, simply as an American who understands that we must come together behind the one man who can lead the way forward in these challenging times, my president, your president, Barack Obama. (Cheers, applause.)\nGod bless you, and God bless America. Thank you so much. (Cheers, applause.)",

        "(Extended cheers, applause.)\nMITT ROMNEY: Thank you. (Cheers, applause.) Mr. Chairman â€” Mr. Chairman and delegates â€” (cheers, applause) â€” Mr. Chairman and delegates, I accept your nomination for president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!\nMITT ROMNEY: I do so with humility, deeply moved by the trust you've placed in me. It's a great honor. It's an even greater responsibility. And tonight I'm asking you to join me to walk together to a better future.\nAnd by my side, I've chosen a man with a big heart from a small town. (Cheers, applause.) He represents the best of America, a man who will always make us very proud â€” my friend and America's next vice president, Paul Ryan. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn the days ahead, you're going to get to know Paul and Janna better. But last night America got to see what I saw in Paul Ryan â€” a strong and caring leader who's down to earth and confident in the challenge this moment demands, and I love the way he lights up around his kids, and how he's not embarrassed to show the world how much he loves his mom.\n(Cheers, applause.) But Paul, I still like the playlist on my iPod better than yours. (Laughter, applause.)\nFour years ago I know that many Americans felt a fresh excitement about the possibilities of a new president. That choice was not the choice of our party, but Americans always come together after elections. We're a good and generous people, and we're united by so much more than what divides us. When that election was over, when the yard signs came down and the television commercials finally came off the air, Americans were eager to go back to work, to live our lives the way Americans always have, optimistic and positive and confident in the future.\nThat very optimism is uniquely American. It's what brought us to America. We're a nation of immigrants. We're the children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the ones who wanted a better life, the driven ones, the ones who woke up at night hearing that voice telling them that life in the place called America could be better. They came not just in pursuit of the riches of this world, but for the richness of this life, freedom, freedom of religion â€” (applause) â€” freedom to speak their mind â€” (applause) â€” freedom to build a life and yes, freedom to build a business with their own hands. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis is the essence of the American experience. We Americans have always felt a special kinship with the future.\nWhen every new wave of immigrants looked up and saw the Statue of Liberty or knelt down and kissed the shores of freedom just 90 miles from Castro's tyranny, these new Americans surely had many questions. But none doubted that here in America, they could build a better life, that in America, their children would be blessed more than they.\nBut today, four years from the excitement of that last election, for the first time, the majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future. It's not what we were promised. Every family in America wanted this to be a time when they could get a little ahead, put aside a little more for college, do more for the elderly mom that's now living alone or give a little more to their church or their charity. Every small business wanted these to be their best years ever, when they could hire more, do more for those who had stuck with them through the hard times, open a new store or sponsor that Little League team. And every new college graduate thought they'd have a good job by now, a place of their own, they could start paying back some of their loans and build for the future.\nThis is when our nation was supposed to start paying down the national debt and rolling back those massive deficits. This was the hope and change America voted for. It's not just what we wanted. It's not just what we expected. It's what Americans deserve. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA!\nMITT ROMNEY: You deserved it because during these years you worked harder than ever before. You deserved it because when it cost more to fill up your car, you could out â€” cut out movie nights and put in longer hours. Or when you lost that job that paid 22.50 (dollars) an hour with benefits, you took two jobs at 9 bucks an hour. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!\nMITT ROMNEY: You deserve it because your family depended on you, and you did it because you're an American, and you don't quit. You did it because it was what you had to do. But driving home late from that second job or standing there watching the gas pump hit $50 and still going, when the realtor told you that to sell your house, you'd have to take a big loss, in those moments you knew that this just wasn't right.\nBut what could you do except work harder, do with less, try to stay optimistic, hug your kids a little longer, maybe spend a little more time praying that tomorrow would be a better day?\nI wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed. (Cheers, applause.) But his promises gave way to disappointment and division.\nThis isn't something we have to accept. Now is the moment when we can do something. And with your help, we will do something. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow is the moment when we can stand up and say, I'm an American, I make my destiny, we deserve better, my children deserve better, my family deserves better, my country deserves better. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo here we stand. Americans have a choice, a decision. To make that choice, you need to know more about me and where I'd lead our country.\nI was born in the middle of the century in the middle of the country, a classic baby boomer. It was a time when Americans were returning from war and eager to work. To be an American was to assume that all things were possible. When President Kennedy challenged Americans to go to the moon, the question wasn't whether we'd get there, it was only when we'd get there. (Cheers, applause.) The soles of Neil Armstrong's boots on the moon made permanent impressions on our souls. Ann and I watched those steps together on her parents' sofa. Like all Americans, we went to bed that night knowing we lived in the greatest country in the history of the world. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!\nMITT ROMNEY: God bless Neil Armstrong. (Cheers, applause.)\nTonight that American flag is still there on the moon, and I don't doubt for a second that Neil Armstrong's spirit is still with us, that unique blend of optimism, humility and the utter confidence that when the world needs someone to do the really big stuff, you need an American. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy dad had been born in Mexico, and his family had to leave during the Mexican Revolution. I grew up with stories of his family being fed by the U.S. government as war refugees. My dad never made it through college, and he apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter.\nHe had big dreams. He convinced my mom, a beautiful young actress, to give up Hollywood to marry him and move to Detroit. He led a great â€” (cheers, applause) â€” he led a great automobile company and became governor of the great state of Michigan. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe were â€” we were Mormons, and growing up in Michigan, that might have seemed unusual or out of place, but I really don't remember it that way. My friends cared more about what sports teams we followed than what church we went to.\nMy mom and dad gave their kids the â€” the greatest gift of all â€” the gift of unconditional love. They cared deeply about who we would be and much less about what we would do. Unconditional love is a gift that Ann and I have tried to pass on to our sons and now to our grandchildren. All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers. (Cheers, applause.) You know, if every children could drift asleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family, and God's love, this world would be a far more gentle and better place.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nMy mom and dad were married for 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was, you could have asked the local florist â€” (laughter) â€” because every day Dad gave Mom a rose, which he put on her bedside table. That's how she found out what happened on the day my father died. She went looking for him because that morning there was no rose.\nMy mom and dad were true partners, a life lesson that shaped my by everyday example. When my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still see her saying, in her beautiful voice, why should women have any less say than men about the great decisions facing our nation? (Cheers, applause.)\nDon't you wish she could have been here at this convention â€” (cheers) â€” and heard leaders like Governor Mary Fallin, Governor Nikki Haley, Governor Susana Martinez, Senator Kelly Ayotte and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice? (Cheers, applause.) As governor of Massachusetts, I chose a woman lieutenant governor, a woman chief of staff. Half of my Cabinet and senior officials were women. And in business, I mentored and supported great women leaders who went on to run great companies.\nI grew up in Detroit in love with cars and wanted to be a car guy like my dad. But by the time I was out of school, I realized that I had to go out on my own, that if I stayed around in the same business, I'd never really know if I was getting a break because of my dad. I wanted to go someplace new and prove myself.\nThose weren't the easiest of days, many long hours and weekends working, five young sons who seemed to have this need to re-enact a different world war every night. (Laughter.) But if you asked Ann and I what we'd give to break up just one more fight between the boys or wake up in the morning and discover a pile of kids asleep in our room â€” well, every mom and dad knows the answer to that.\nThose days were the â€” (cheers, applause) â€” these were tough days, on Ann particularly. She was heroic through it all. Five boys, with our families a long way away. I had to travel a lot for my job then, and I'd call and try to offer support. But every mom knows that doesn't help get the homework done or get the kids out the door to school. And I knew that her job as a mom was harder than mine, and I knew without question that her job as a mom was a lot more important than mine. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd as America saw Tuesday night, Ann would have succeeded at anything she wanted to do. (Cheers, applause.)\nLike a lot of families in a new place with no family, we â€” we found kinship with a wide circle of friends through our church. When we were new to the community, it was welcoming. And as the years went by, it was a joy to help others who had just moved into town or just joined our church.\nWe had remarkably vibrant and diverse congregations from all walks of life, and many who were new to America. We prayed together. Our kids played together. And we always stood ready to help each other out in different ways.\nThat's how it is in America. We look to our communities, our faiths, our families for our joy, our support in good times and bad. It's both how we live our lives and why we live our lives. The strength and power and goodness of America has always been based on the strength and power and goodness of our communities, our families and our faiths. (Cheers, applause.)\nThat's the bedrock of what makes America America. In our best days we can feel the vibrancy of America's communities, large and small. It's when we see that new business opening up downtown. It's when we go to work in the morning and see everybody else on the block doing the same thing. It's when our son or daughter calls from college to talk about which job they â€” offer they should take, and you try not to choke up when you hear that the one they like best is not too far from home. It's that good feeling when you have more time to volunteer to coach your kids' soccer team or help out on school trips.\nBut for too many Americans, those kind of good days are harder to come by. How many days have you woken up feeling that something really special was happening in America?\nMany of you felt that way on Election Day four years ago. Hope and change had a powerful appeal.\nBut tonight I'd ask a simple question.\nIf you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn't you feel that way now that he's President Obama? (Applause.) You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him. (Laughter, cheers, applause.)\nThe president hasn't disappointed you because he wanted to. The president has disappointed America because he hasn't led America in the right direction. He took office with â€” without the basic qualification that most Americans have, and one that was essential to the task at hand: He had almost no experience working in a business. Jobs, to him, are about government. (Cheers, applause.)\nI learned the real lessons about how America works from experience. When I was 37, I helped start a small company. My partners and I had been working for a company that was in the business of helping other businesses. So some of us had this idea that if we really believed our advice was helping companies, we should invest in companies; we should bet on ourselves and our â€” on our advice. So we started a new business called Bain Capital.\nThe only problem was, while â€” while we believed in ourselves, not many other people did. (Laughter.) We were young and had never done this before, and we almost didn't get off the ground. In those days, sometimes I wondered if I had made a really big mistake.\nBy the way, I'd thought about asking my church's pension fund to invest, but I didn't. (Laughter.) I figured it was bad enough that I might lose my investors' money, but I didn't want to go to hell, too.\n(Laughter, applause.) Shows what I know. Another of my partners got the Episcopal Church Pension Fund to invest â€” (laughter) â€” and today there are a lot of happy retired priests who should thank him. (Laughter, applause.)\nThat business we started with 10 people has now grown into a great American success story. Some of the companies we helped start are names you â€” you know and you've heard from tonight: an office company called Staples, where I'm pleased to see the Obama campaign's been shopping â€” (laughter, applause) â€” the Sports Authority, which of course became a favorite of my boys; we helped start an early childhood learning company called Bright Horizons that First Lady Michelle Obama rightly praised; and at a time when nobody thought we'd ever see a new steel mill built in America, we took a chance and built one in a cornfield in Indiana, that today â€” (cheers, applause) â€” today Steel Dynamics is one of the largest steel producers in the United States.\nThese â€” (applause) â€” these are American success stories. (Applause.) And yet the centerpiece of the president's entire re- election campaign is attacking success. Is it any wonder that someone who attacks success has led the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression? (Cheers, applause.) In America, we celebrate success; we don't apologize for success. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow â€” now, we weren't always successful at Bain, but no one ever is in the real world of business. That's what this president doesn't seem to understand. Business and growing jobs is about taking risk, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding, but always striving. It's about dreams. Usually, it doesn't work out exactly as you might have imagined. Steve Jobs was fired at Apple, and then he came back and changed the world.\nIt's the genius of the American free enterprise system to harness the extraordinary creativity and talent and industry of the American people with a system that's dedicated to creating tomorrow's prosperity, not trying to redistribute today's. (Extended cheers, applause.)\nThat's why â€” that's why every president since the Great Depression who came before the American people asking for a second term could look back at the last four years and say with satisfaction: You're better off than you were four years ago. Except Jimmy Carter. (Laughter.) And except this president. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis president can ask us to be patient. This president can tell us it was someone else's fault. This president can tell us that the next four years he'll get it right. But this president cannot tell us that you're better off today than when he took office.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nAmerica's been patient. Americans have supported this president in good faith. But today the time has come to turn the page. Today the time has come for us to put the disappointments of the last four years behind us, to put aside the divisiveness and the recriminations, to forget about what might have been and to look ahead to what can be. Now is a time to restore the promise of America. (Cheers, applause.)\nMany Americans have given up on this president, but they haven't ever thought about giving up, not on themselves, not on each other and not on America. What is needed in our country today is not complicated or profound. Doesn't take a special government commission to tell us what America needs. What America needs is jobs, lots of jobs. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn the richest country in the history of the world, this Obama economy has crushed the middle class. Family income has fallen by $4,000, but health insurance premiums are higher. Food prices are higher. Utility bills are higher. And gasoline prices, they've doubled. Today more Americans wake up in poverty than ever before. Nearly 1-out-of-6 Americans is living in poverty. Look around you. These aren't strangers. These are our brothers and sisters, our fellow Americans. His policies have not helped create jobs. They've depressed them.\nAnd this I can tell you about where President Obama would take America.\nHis plan to raise taxes on small business won't add jobs: It would eliminate them. (Cheers, applause.) His assault on coal and gas and oil will send energy and manufacturing jobs to China. (Mixed boos, cheers, applause.) His trillion-dollar cuts to our military will eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs and also put our security at greater risk. (Boos.) His $716 billion cut to Medicare to finance \"Obamacare\" will both hurt today's seniors and oppress innovation and jobs in medicine. (Boos.) And his trillion-dollar deficits, they slow our economy, restrain employment and cause wages to stall.\nTo the majority of Americans who now believe that the future will not be better than the past, I can guarantee you this: If Barack Obama is re-elected, you'll be right. (Applause.)\nI'm running for president to help create a better future â€” a future where everyone who wants a job can find a job â€” (cheers, applause) â€” where no senior feels for the â€” fears for the security of their retirement, an America where every parent knows that their child will get an education that leads them to a good job and a bright horizon.\nAnd unlike the president, I have a plan to create 12 million new jobs. (Cheers, applause.) Paul Ryan and I have five steps. First, by 2020, North America will be energy-independent by taking full advantage of our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear and our renewables. (Cheers, applause.)\nSecond, we'll give our fellow citizens the skills they need for the jobs of today and the careers of tomorrow. When it comes to the school your child will attend, every parent should have a choice and every child should have a chance. (Cheers, applause.)\nThird, we'll make trade work for America by forging new trade agreements. And when nations cheat in trade, there will be unmistakable consequences. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd fourth, to assure every entrepreneur and every job creator that their investments in America will not vanish as have those in Greece, we will cut the deficit and put America on track to a balanced budget. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd fifth, we will champion small businesses, America's engine of job growth. That means reducing taxes on business, not raising them. It means simplifying and modernizing the regulations that hurt small business the most. (Cheers, applause.) And it means that we must rein in the skyrocketing cost of health care by repealing and replacing \"Obamacare.\" (Cheers, applause.)\nToday women are more likely than men to start a business. They need a president who respects and understands what they do.\nAnd let me make this very clear: unlike President Obama, I will not raise taxes on the middle class of America. (Cheers, applause.)\nAs president, I'll protect the sanctity of life. I'll honor the institution of marriage. (Cheers, applause.) And I will guarantee America's first liberty, the freedom of religion. (Cheers, applause.)\nPresident Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans â€” (laughter) â€” and to heal the planet. My promise is to help you and your family. (Cheers, applause.)\nI will begin my presidency with a jobs tour. President Obama began his presidency with an apology tour. America, he said, had dictated to other nations. No, Mr. President, America has freed other nations from dictators. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) We want Mitt! We want Mitt! We want Mitt! We want Mitt!\nMITT ROMNEY: Every American â€”\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) We want Mitt! We want Mitt! We want Mitt! We want Mitt!\nMITT ROMNEY: Every American was relieved the day President Obama gave the order and Seal Team 6 took out Osama bin Laden. (Cheers, applause.)\nOn another front, every American is less secure today because he has failed to slow Iran's nuclear threat. In his first TV interview as president, he said we should talk to Iran. We're still talking, and Iran's centrifuges are still spinning.\nPresident Obama has thrown allies like Israel under the bus â€” (boos) â€” even has he as relaxed sanctions on Castro's Cuba. He abandoned our friends in Poland by walking away from our missile defense commitments. (Boos.) But he's eager to give Russia's president, Putin, the flexibility he desires after the election. (Boos.) Under my administration, our friends will see more loyalty, and Mr. Putin will see a little less flexibility and more backbone. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe will honor America's democratic ideals, because a free world is a more peaceful world. This is the bipartisan foreign policy legacy of Truman and Reagan, and under my presidency, we will return to it once again. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou might have asked yourself if these last years are really the America we want â€”\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nMITT ROMNEY: â€” the America that was won for us by \"the greatest generation.\"\nDoes the America we want borrow a trillion dollars from China?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nMITT ROMNEY: Does it fail to find the jobs that are needed for 23 million people and for half the kids graduating from college?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nMITT ROMNEY: Are those schools lagging behind the rest of the developed world?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nMITT ROMNEY: And does America that we want succumb to resentment and division among Americans?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nMITT ROMNEY: The America we all know has been a story of the many becoming one, uniting to preserve liberty, uniting to build the greatest economy in the world, uniting to save the world from unspeakable darkness. Everywhere I go in America, there are monuments that list those who have given their lives for America. There's no mention of their race, their party affiliation or what they did for a living. (Cheers, applause.) They lived and died under a single flag, fighting for a single purpose.\nThey pledged allegiance to the United States of America. That America, that united America, can unleash an economy that will put Americans back to work, that will once again lead the world with innovation and productivity and that will restore every father and mother's confidence that their children's future is brighter even than the past.\nThat America, that united America, will preserve a military that's so strong no nation would ever dare to test it. (Cheers, applause.)\nThat America â€” that America, that united America, will uphold the constellation of rights that were endowed by our creator and codified in our Constitution. (Cheers, applause.)\nThat united America will care for the poor and the sick, will honor and respect the elderly and will give a helping hand to those in need.\nThat America is the best within each of us. That America we want for our children. If I'm elected president of these United States, I will work with all my energy and soul to restore that America, to lift our eyes to a better future. That future is our destiny. That future is out there. It is waiting for us. Our children deserve it. Our nation depends on it. The peace and freedom of the world require it, and with your help, we will deliver it. (Cheers, applause.) Let us begin that future for America tonight. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you so very much. May God bless you, may God bless the American people and may God bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nMARCO RUBIO: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I think I just drank Clint Eastwood's water. Thank you. (Laughter.) Boy, thank you so much. Thank you so much for having me here today, and thank you so much for doing this convention here in Florida.\nYou know, before I begin this â€” thank you. Before I begin, this is such an important night for our country. I want to take just â€” with your permission, just a few seconds to talk about another country, a country located just a few hundred miles away from this city, the country of my parents' birth. There is no freedom or liberty in Cuba. And tonight, I ask for your prayers that soon freedom and liberty will be theirs as well. (Cheers, applause.)\nIt â€” you know, this is a big honor for me. Just not so long ago I was just a deep underdog candidate. The only people that thought I could win all lived in my house. (Laughter.) Four of them were under the age of 10. (Laughter.) But this is incredible. When I was asked to introduce Governor Romney â€” who we'll hear from in just a moment. I promise you, he's backstage, ready to go. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd â€” so I called a few people and asked them, what should I say? And they had a lot of different opinions, but the one thing they all said is, don't mess it up. (Laughter.)\nSo I thought the best way to introduce Mitt Romney tonight, the next president of the United States â€” (cheers, applause) â€” is to talk â€” is to talk about what this election is about. And I'm so honored to be able to do it here in Florida at the Republican National Convention in front of all you patriots. (Cheers, applause.)\nI watched my first convention in 1980 with my grandfather. My grandfather was born to a farming family in rural Cuba. Childhood polio left him permanently disabled. Because he couldn't work the farm, his family sent him to school. He was the only one in his family that knew how to read. He was a huge influence on me growing up. As a boy, I used to sit on the porch of our house and listen to his stories about history and politics and baseball as he would puff on one of his three daily Padron cigars.\nNow, I don't remember â€” it's been three decades since we last sat on that porch, and I don't remember all the things he talked to me about. But the one thing I remember is the one thing he wanted me never to forget, that the dreams he had when he was young became impossible to achieve. But there was no limit how far I could go, because I was an American. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, for those of us â€” here's why I say that. Here's why I say that, because for those of us who were born and raised in this country, sometimes it becomes easy to forget how special America is. But my grandfather understood how different America was from the rest of the world because he knew life outside America.\nTonight you will hear from another man who understands what makes America exceptional.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nMitt Romney knows America's prosperity didn't happen because our government simply spent more money. It happened because our people used their own money to open a business. And when they succeed, they hire more people who invest or spend their money in the economy, helping others start a business or create jobs.\nNow tonight you have heard for a long time now about Mitt Romney's success in business. It's well-known. But we've also learned that he's so much more than that. Mitt Romney is a devoted husband, a father, a grandfather, a generous member of his community and church, a role model for younger Americans like myself. Everywhere he's been, he's volunteered his time and talent to make things better for those around him. And we are blessed that a man like this will soon be the president of these United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, let me be clear so no one misunderstands. Our problem with President Obama isn't that he's a bad person, OK? By all accounts, he, too, is a good husband and a good father and, thanks to lots of practice, a good golfer. (Laughter.) Our problem is not that he's a bad person. Our program is that he's a bad president. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou think he's watching tonight? (Laughter.) Because his new slogan for his campaign is the word \"forward.\" Forward?\nA government that spends $1 trillion more than it takes in? An $800 billion stimulus that created more debt than jobs? A government intervention into health care paid for with higher taxes and cuts to Medicare, scores of new rules and regulations â€” these ideas don't move us forward. These ideas move us backwards. (Cheers, applause.)\nThese are tired and old big-government ideas that have failed every time and everywhere they've been tried. These are ideas that people come to America to get away from. (Cheers, applause.) These are ideas that threaten to make a more â€” America more like the rest of the world instead of helping the rest of the world become more like America. (Cheers, applause.)\nAs for his old slogan, under Barack Obama, the only change is that hope is hard to find. (Laughter.)\nNow, sadly, millions of Americans are insecure about their future. But instead of inspiring us, by reminding us of what makes us special, he divides us against each other. He tells Americans that they're worse off because others are better off, that rich people got rich by making other people poor. Hope and change has become divide and conquer. (Cheers, applause.)\nBut in the end, this election â€” it doesn't matter how you feel about President Obama because this election is about your future, not about his. And â€” (cheers, applause) â€” and this election is not simply a choice between a Democrat and a Republican.\nIt's a choice about what kind of country we want America to be. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd as we prepare to make this choice, we should remember what made us special. You see, for most of human history, almost everybody was poor. Power and wealth only belonged to a few. Your rights were whatever your rulers allowed you to have. Your future was determined by your past. If you parents were poor, so would you be. If you were born without opportunities, so were your children.\nBut America was founded on the principle that every person has God-given rights â€” (cheers, applause) â€” founded on the belief that power belongs to the people, that government exists to protect our rights and serve our interests and that no one should be trapped in the circumstances of their birth. We should be free to go as far as our talent and our work can take us. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd we're special â€” we're special because we're united â€” we're united not as a common race or a common ethnicity, we're bound together by common values, that family's the most important institution in society â€” (cheers, applause) â€” and that Almighty God is the source of all we have. (Cheers, extended applause.)\nWe're special â€” we're special because we've never made the mistake of believing that we are so smart that we can rely solely on our leaders or on our government â€” our national motto, \"In God we trust,\" reminding us that faith in our creator is the most important American value of them all.\n(Cheers, applause.) And we're special â€” we're special because we've always understood the scriptural admonition that for everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required. (Applause.)\nWell, my fellow Americans, we are a uniquely blessed people. And we have honored those blessings with the enduring example of an exceptional America. (Applause.)\nI know for many of you watching at home tonight, the last few years have tested your faith in the promise of America. Maybe you're at an age when you thought you would be entering retirement, but now because your savings and investments are wiped out, your future is uncertain. Maybe after years of hard work, this was the time you expected to be your prime earning years, but instead you've been laid off, and your house is worth less than your mortgage. Maybe you did everything you were told you needed to do to get ahead, you studied hard and finished school, but now you owe thousands of dollars in student loans, you can't find a job in your field and you've had to move back in with your parents. You want to believe that we're still that special place where anything is possible, but you just don't seem â€” things just don't seem to be getting any better. And you wonder if things will ever be the same again.\nYes, we live in a troubled time, but the story of those who came before us reminds us that America has always been about new beginnings, and Mitt Romney is running for president because he knows that if we are willing to do for our children what our parents did for us, life in America can be better than it has ever been.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nMy mother was one of seven girls whose parents often went to bed hungry so their children wouldn't. My father lost his mother when he was 9. He had to leave school and go to work, and he would work for the next 70 years of his life. They immigrated to America with little more than the hope of a better life. My dad was a bartender. My mom was a cashier, a hotel maid, a stock clerk at Kmart. They never made it big. They were never rich. And yet they were successful, because just a few decades removed from hopelessness, they made possible for us all the things that had been impossible for them.\nMany nights growing up, I would hear my father's keys jingling at the door as he came home after another 16-hour day. Many mornings I woke up just as my mother got home from the overnight shift at Kmart. When you're young and you're in a hurry, the meaning of moments like this escape you. But now as my children get older, I understand it better.\nMy dad used to tell us, en ese pais, ustedes van a poder lograr todas las cosas que nosotros no pudimos â€” (cheers, applause) â€” in this country â€” in this country, you're going to be able to accomplish all the things we never could. A few years ago during a speech, I noticed a bartender behind a portable bar in the back of the ballroom. And I remembered my father, who worked for many years as a banquet bartender. He was grateful for the work he had. But that's not the life he wanted for us.\nYou see, he stood behind a bar and â€” in the back of the room all those years so one day I could stand behind a podium in the front of a room. (Cheers, applause.)\nThat journey, that journey from behind that bar to behind this podium goes to the essence of the American miracle, that we're exceptional not because we have more rich people here; we're special because dreams that are impossible anywhere else, they come true here.\nBut â€” (cheers, applause) â€” but that's not just my story. That's your story. That's our story. That's the story of your mothers who struggled to give you what they never had. That's the story of your fathers who worked two jobs so that the doors that had been closed for them would be open for you. That's the story of that teacher or that coach that taught you the lessons that made you who you are today.\nAnd it's the story of a man who was born into an uncertain future in a foreign country. His family came to America to escape revolution. They struggled through poverty and the Great Depression. And yet he rose to be an admired businessman and public servant. And in November his son Mitt Romney will be elected president of these United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn America â€”\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!\nMARCO RUBIO: In America, we are all just a generation or two removed from someone who made our future the purpose of their lives. America is the story of everyday people who did extraordinary things, a story woven deep into the fabric of our society. Their stories may never be famous, but in the lives they live, you will find the essence of America's greatness. And to make sure that America is still a place where tomorrow is always better than yesterday, that is what our politics should be about, and that is what we are deciding this election. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe decide, do we want our children to inherit our hopes and dreams, or do we want them to inherit our problems? Because Mitt Romney believes that if we succeed in changing the direction of our country, our children and grandchildren will be the most prosperous generation ever, and their achievements will astonish the world. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe story of our time will be written by Americans who haven't yet even been born. Let us make sure they write that we did our part, that in the early years of this new century, we lived in an uncertain time, but we did not allow fear to cause us to abandon what made us special. We chose more government instead of more freedom (sic). We chose the principles of our founding to solve the challenges of our time.\nWe chose a special man to lead us in a special time. We chose Mitt Romney to lead our nation. And because we did, the American miracle lives on for another generation to inherit. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy fellow Republicans, my fellow Americans, I am proud to introduce to you the next president of the United States of America, Mitt Romney! (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nCLINT EASTWOOD: Thank you very much. (Sustained cheers, applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: (Chanting.) We want (Clint/Mitt ?)! We want (Clint/Mitt ?)! We want (Clint/Mitt ?)!\nCLINT EASTWOOD: (Chuckles.) Save a little for Mitt. (Laughter.)\nNow, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, what's a movie tradesman doing out here? You know, they're all left-wingers out there, left of Lenin. (Laughter.) At least that's what people think, but that's not really the case. There is a lot of conservative people, a lot of moderate people, Republicans, Democrats in Hollywood. It's just that conservative people, by the nature of the word itself, are â€” play it a little more close to vest. They don't go around hot- dogging it.\nSo â€” (cheers, applause) â€” but they are there. Believe me, they are there. And I just â€” I think, in fact, there's some of them around town. I saw Jon Voight. There's a lot of people around here â€” (inaudible). (Cheers, applause.) Jon's here, an Academy Award winner, terrific guy. And these people are all like-minded, like all of us.\nSo I've got â€” I've got Mr. Obama sitting here. (Laughter.) And he's â€” I just was going to ask him a couple questions. But â€” you know, about â€” I remember 3 1/2 years ago when Mr. Obama won the election. And though I wasn't a big supporter, I was watching that night when he was having that thing and they were talking about hope and change, and they were talking about \"Yes, we can.\" And it was dark and â€” outdoors. And it was nice. And people were lighting candles, and they were saying, you know â€” and I just thought, this is great. I mean, everybody's crying. Oprah was crying. And â€” (laughter) â€” I was even crying. (Laughter.)\nAnd then finally â€” I haven't cried that hard since I found out that there's 23 million unemployed people in this country. (Cheers, applause.) And now that is something to cry for because that is a disgrace, a national disgrace. And we haven't done enough, obviously. This administration hasn't done enough to cure that. And whatever interest they have is not strong enough. And I think possibly now it may be time for somebody else to come along and solve the problem. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo, Mr. President, how do you â€” how do you handle â€” or how do you handle promises that you've made when you're running for election, and how do you handle â€” how do you handle it? I mean, what do you say to people? Do you â€” do you just â€” (laughter) â€” you know, I know people were wondering, you don't â€” (inaudible) â€” OK.\nWell, I know even some of the people in your own party who were very disappointed when you didn't close Gitmo. And I thought â€” well, I think closing Gitmo, why close that? We spent so much money on it.\nBut I thought maybe it's an excuse â€” you know, what do you mean shut up? (Laughter.) (Inaudible.) OK. It just â€” I thought it was just because somebody had the stupid idea of trying terrorists in downtown New York City. Maybe that was it. (Laughter, applause.)\nI've got a â€” I've got to hand it to you. I've got to give credit where credit's due. You did overrule that finally, and that's â€” so now we're moving onward.\nAnd I know in the â€” I know you were against the war in Iraq, and that's OK. But you thought the war in Afghanistan was OK. You know, I mean, you thought that was something that was worth doing. We didn't check with the Russians to see how they did there for the 10 years. (Laughter, applause.) But we did it. And it was â€” you know, it's something to be thought about. And I think that when we get to maybe â€” I think you mentioned something about having a target date for bringing everybody home.\nAnd you give that target date, and I think Mr. Romney asked the only sensible question on it. He said, why are you giving the date out now? Why don't you just bring them home tomorrow morning? (Laughter, cheers, applause.) And I thought â€” I thought, yeah, there's a â€” I'm not going to â€” shut up. It's my turn. (Laughter.) So anyway, we got â€” we're going to have â€” we're going to have to have a little chat about that.\nAnd then I just wondered, these â€” all these promises. And then I wondered about, you know, when the â€” what? What do you want me to tell Romney? I can't tell him to do that. Can't do that to himself. (Laughter.) You're crazy. You're absolutely crazy. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) You're getting as bad as Biden. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) Of course, we all know Biden is â€” Biden is the intellect of the Democratic Party, so â€” (inaudible) â€” (laughter, cheers, applause) â€” we have a â€” just a kind of a â€” kind of a grin with a body behind it, you know â€” (inaudible) â€” (laughter).\nSo anyway â€” but I just â€” I just think that there's so much to be done. And I think that Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan are two guys that can come along. I â€” see, I never thought that it was a good idea for attorneys to be president anyway, because it's â€” (laughter, cheers, applause) â€” yeah.\nI think â€” I think attorneys are so busy â€” you know, they're always taught to argue everything and always weigh everything and weigh both sides, and they're always â€” you know, they're always â€” Mr. Devil's advocating this and bifurcating this and bifurcating that â€” you know, all of that stuff. But I think it's maybe time â€” what do you think â€” for maybe a businessman. How about that? (Cheers, applause.)\nA stellar businessman, quote-unquote, a stellar businessman. And I think it's that time. And I think if you just kind of stepped aside and Mr. Romney can kind of take over â€” you can still use the plane â€” (laughter) â€” though maybe a smaller one, not that big gas guzzler that you're driving around when you're going around to colleges and talking about student loans and stuff like that. I think â€” (laughter) â€” you're an ecological man. Now, why would you want to drive that truck around? (Laughter.) OK.\nWell, anyway â€” all right, I'm sorry. I can't do that to myself, either. (Laughter, applause.) Anyway, OK.\nBut I'd just like to say something, ladies and gentlemen, something that I think is very important. It is that you â€” we own this country. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Yes, we own it. And it's not you owning it and not politicians owning it â€” politicians are employees of ours, and â€” (cheers, applause) â€” so they're just going to come around and beg for votes every few years.\nIt's their same old deal. But I just think that it's important that you realize that â€” and â€” that you're the best in the world. And whether you're Democrat or whether you're Republican or whether you're libertarian or whatever, you're the best, and we should not ever forget that. And we â€” when somebody does not do the job, we've got to let them go. (Cheers, applause.) Let them go. (Cheers, applause.) (Inaudible.)\nOK. Yeah. OK. Just remember that. And I'm speaking out for everybody out there. It doesn't hurt we don't have to be â€”\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) (Audience murmurs.)\nCLINT EASTWOOD: I don't say that word anymore. (Laughter.) Well, maybe one last time. (Audience shouting.) We don't have to be â€” what I'm saying is we don't have to be (mental ?) masochists and vote for somebody that we don't even really want in the â€” in the â€” in office. We â€” just because they seem to be nice guys or maybe not so nice guys, if you look at some of the recent ads going out there. I don't know. (Audience shouting, applause.)\nOK. You want to make my day, eh? All right. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) I â€” all right. I'll start it. You finish it.\nGo ahead.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (We want Mitt ?)!\nCLINT EASTWOOD: Thank you.

I won my first gold medal in Atlanta in the summer of 1996, and I just â€” (cheers, applause) â€” returned from the Olympics in London a few weeks ago with another gold medal. This â€” (cheers, applause) â€” this was one of a record-setting hundred and four medals won by Team USA â€” (cheers) â€” including 58 by women, which is the most ever. I think it's safe to say we showed the world that women of America are a force to be reckoned with. (Cheers, applause.)\nI am honored to share the stage tonight with a handful of Olympic champions. Allow me to introduce them to you: Dan Jansen, an American favorite throughout four Olympiads and gold medalist. (Cheers, applause.) Andy Gabel, a four-time short track speedskating Olympian and a silver medal-winner. (Cheers, applause.) Rowdy Gaines, an Olympic Hall of Famer and three-time Olympic gold medal- winner. (Cheers, applause.) Lea Ann Parsley, a silver medalist in the women's skeleton in 2002. (Cheers, applause.) Noelle Pikus-Pace, the 2007 skeleton world champion and 2010 Olympian. (Cheers, applause.) Bill Schuffenhauer, a three-time Olympic and Olympic bobsled silver medalist in 2002. (Cheers, applause.) Jimmy Shea, the only third-generation Olympian winning the gold medal in skeleton in 2002. (Cheers, applause.) Jean Racine-Prahm, a two-time World Cup champion bobsledder and two-time Olympian. (Cheers, applause.)\nScott Hamilton, an American icon, 1984 Gold Medalist known for his back flip(s). (Cheers, applause.) Christopher Delvin-Young, an American Paralympic alpine skier who won two Gold Medals and two Silver Medals. (Cheers, applause.) Derek Parra, a Gold and Silver Medalist speed skater in 2002.

USA!\nKIM RHODE: From the time when I walked into the Olympic Games in Atlanta as a wide-eyed 16-year-old, to the moment a few weeks ago when I heard our national anthem played in London as a seasoned veteran, I've seen our country both prosper, and more recently, falter. Not unlike my athletic career, there were many times when things were going very well, and times when they were not. It was in those times when things were difficult that I learned to rely on strong leadership to get me, as they would say in my world, back on target â€” the strong leadership of a more experienced teammate, of my coaches, and of course, most importantly, the strong leadership of my mom and dad. (Cheers, applause.)\nI came here tonight because I believe that today our country is off-target. We need the leadership of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to turn our country around â€” (cheers, applause) â€” so that millions of Americans who have taken aim at their own dreams, whatever they may be, have the opportunity for those dreams to come true, just like our Olympic dreams did. We need strong leadership, we need new leadership and we need it now. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe are here on stage because we know Americans need the leadership of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. Thank you all so much, and good night. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA! USA!\nMIKE ERUZIONE: OK. Thank you. Thank you.\nGood evening. I'm Mike Eruzione. (Cheers, applause.) And I am honored to have this opportunity tonight to talk with you about the global significance of the Olympic movement, its ideals and its meaning, and how it was rescued by Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nIt has been over 10 years so many of you may have forgotten, but in 2002, due to bribery scandals and mismanagement, the Olympics, not just those games, but the Olympics as an institution were threatened.\nThankfully, Mitt Romney was there to salvage a desperate situation.\nMitt's leadership not only turned around those games by solving the operational and financing problems, but he did something deeper. He drew a line in the sand and said that the 2002 games would have the highest standards of ethics and integrity.\n(Cheers, applause.) He put Olympians, the athletes, and the ideals of the Olympics back at the center of the games. He focused on restoring the Olympics to the top pedestal of sports, and he preserved the opportunity and idealism of the Olympics for future generations. I was fortunate to compete in the Olympics as captain of the 1980 U.S. \"Miracle on Ice\" hockey team. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA!\nMIKE ERUZIONE: And that team â€” and that team was proud and honored to light the cauldron for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. That action of passing along the flame of the Olympic spirit symbolizes something grander than all of us. It is the single greatest movement that brings all humans across the world together. We are all fortunate that Mitt Romney kept that fire burning. (Cheers, applause.)\nAs a result of the 2002 Olympics, I had the opportunity to get to know Mitt and Ann Romney and to see what they have accomplished. Mitt is a brilliant leader who is committed to the highest ideals, and he is a wonderful and caring family man. Just like the Olympics needed Mitt's leadership 10 years ago, America desperately needs Mitt Romney's leadership today. (Cheers, applause.)\nPlease join me in making him the next president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you.\nDEREK PARRA: I'm Derek Parra. I'm a 5-foot-4 Mexican-American from Southern California. (Cheers, applause.) Now, those are just three reasons it didn't add up for me to have ever become Winter Olympic champion. (Laughter.)\nBut somehow, from inside a roller rink as a teenager, a dream grew within my heart that someday, maybe, I could represent my country at the Olympic Games. And I chased that dream for over 20 years, and eventually it led me to Salt Lake City. (Cheers, applause.) With great effort and the help of some amazing people along the way, I had become one of the top speed skaters in the world, and the finish line was in sight. But as the Olympics appeared on the horizon, that dream was almost derailed.\nThe Olympics were mired in scandal and budget deficit â€” and even worse, the national tragedy of September 11th that shook our entire nation to its very core. It was a time of uncertainty.\nBut in my Olympic world, Mitt Romney was at the helm. (Cheers, applause.) His vision and commitment got the games back on track and gave me the opportunity to realize my athletic dreams. Not only did Mitt facilitate my dream in 2002, he facilitated the dreams of all athletes from around the world. (Cheers, applause.)\nAt that time, I had only met Mitt briefly. But after the Olympics, I got to know him, and for a period of time I lived with him and his family.\nI know Mitt, and I know him well. I know him as a businessman and as a leader. I know him as a father and as a very, very busy grandfather. And I'm proud to say that I know him as a friend. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, you might think my greatest Olympic moment came when I stood on the podium for the first time with a gold medal wrapped around my neck. But you'd be wrong. In fact, the â€” my most powerful Olympic memory came before the Olympics even started. It's a story I've heard Mitt reference a number of times on the campaign trail, so I'd like to share with you firsthand what it was like for me.\nFebruary 8th, 2002, was a cold but clear night in Salt Lake City. It was the night of the opening ceremony. I was competing the very next morning, so I was planning not to attend. But that all changed the second I got the call from the U.S. Olympic Committee just hours before the ceremony asking me if I would be able to be one of the eight athletes selected to carry the World trade Center flag into the opening ceremonies. (Cheers, applause.)\nI was floored. Instantly I knew it was something I had to do, something I wanted to do. It was an honor beyond anything I could have ever imagined. And while it's now just over 10 years later, at that time our country was still reeling from the wounds, the trauma and the pain of September 11th.\nAs the opening ceremonies got under way and the flag-bearing athletes and I gathered backstage, we were standing with the Port Authority officers whose job it was to oversee the flag.\nThey began telling us how proud they were of us, that the families of the victims were proud of us, that all the people who lost their lives were proud of us.\nWhen it came time to begin the procession, I touched the flag for the first time, and I remember a physical sensation unlike anything I'd ever experienced. (Applause.) If it's possible â€” if it's possible to feel your soul being touched, then that's what I felt.\nAs we carried the flag out before a capacity crowd and a worldwide television audience, the silence was deafening. That flag, which has flown over so much pain and loss, still stood for life, love and the hope of a nation. (Cheers, applause.)\nThere are few times in any life when the emotion of a moment is all that exists. That night time stood still. As our national anthem rang out like never before, I stood there holding that flag, the symbol of everything our country had ever been through, with tears streaming down my face.\nThat moment came under the leadership of Mitt Romney. (Applause.) And it not only inspired me, but it inspired all of Team USA, and we went on to win a record number of medals.\nToday our country is struggling, but the right leaders can inspire us to push on, overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges and to accomplish great things.\nMitt Romney is that kind of leader. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you, and God bless. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Applause.)\nJANE EDMONDS: Thank you for the warm welcome. I am honored to be here with you tonight to share my feelings about Mitt Romney. By way of background, my politics is as a liberal Democrat. My passion is about education, workforce training and leadership.\nWhen I first met Governor Romney, I was struck by his humanity, his grace, his kind manner.\nIt was just the two of us in his office when I met him as a finalist for a Cabinet position in his administration. I could tell immediately just by our interaction that he is the real thing, authentic. (Cheers, applause.)\nHe struck me then and now as honest, transparent and inclusive. I somehow knew during that meeting that he is demanding of himself, and â€” (chuckles) â€” he'd be demanding of anyone who is part of his administration. I wanted to be around him and in that kind of environment, where my energy, skills and talents could be channeled along with others toward the public good.\nI could tell by our conversation that the governor was in office not for himself or to promote himself but for the people. (Cheers, applause.) My initial size-up of the man held true. During the four years I served in his Cabinet, I saw him up close and personal many times. And he always drove us in his administration to make government better for the people.\nOne area where he made a positive difference is in improving the representation of women in senior positions in Massachusetts state government. (Cheers, applause.)\nBefore Governor Romney took office in 2003, women were significantly underrepresented among top roles in government, with 52 percent of the population but just 30 percent of the jobs. Over the next 2 1/2 years 42 percent of the new appointments made by Governor Romney were women. (Cheers, applause.) In fact, based on a survey by the State University of New York, Massachusetts was ranked first in percentage of women holding top state positions. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis led the Boston Globe to note, women fill 10 of 20 top positions in Governor Mitt Romney's administration, making the Commonwealth one of five states that come close to matching the percentage of top women appointees to the proportion of women in the overall population. This achievement happened because Mitt Romney cared about the issue, he took action to fix it, and he delivered results. (Cheers, applause.)\nHe is unquestionably an amazing steward and leader, a servant leader and someone whom I respect very much. That's the kind of leadership that has always inspired me: unselfish leadership. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe late Stephen Covey writes about two kinds of people.\nOne type is all about themselves and their success, and the other type works as hard as they can â€” and certainly succeeds â€” but their success is motivated by doing good for others. That's how I see Governor Romney. He is authentic.\nHe is open to good ideas, wherever they come from. It doesn't matter if they're from a liberal Democrat like me. He'll listen, and he's inclusive. As a great leader, he brought out the best in me. And I know, as president, he will bring out the best in our country. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nKERRY HEALEY: Ten years ago, as chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party â€” (cheers, applause) â€” I flew to Salt Lake City not to see the Olympics but to meet the man who had saved them. I had a message from the grass roots: Come back to Massachusetts; our state needs you. Mitt Romney had turned around companies and turned around the Olympics. Now Massachusetts needed Mitt Romney to turn us around.\nMassachusetts was in deep trouble. We had a massive budget gap and soaring unemployment. People in my state were losing hope for themselves, their families and their children, sadly, very much like our country finds itself today.\nMitt Romney answered the call of service and accepted the challenge.\nHow did he fix our state? Well, he quickly assembled a Cabinet of the best and the brightest, drawing on both parties, Republicans and Democrats, half women, half men, to give him the full spectrum of ideas and advice. He respected different opinions. He valued open debate. And when it was all said and done, Mitt Romney knew how to make a decision. (Cheers, applause.)\nGovernor Romney did what many thought was impossible. He turned around a $3 billion budget gap and created a $2 billion rainy day fund. He even worked to streamline government but at the same time made certain to safeguard protections for the elderly, children and the homeless.\nIn education, Governor Romney gave parents more choices, insisted on tough standards for both teachers and students, and Massachusetts schools became the best in the nation. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe cleared out regulations on small businesses, and we cut taxes 19 times. (Cheers, applause.) And as a result, unemployment dropped to only 4.7 percent. And unlike President Obama, Governor Romney's economic policies were rewarded with a credit upgrade. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, those are the facts and figures, but when people find out that I served as Mitt Romney's lieutenant governor, they always ask me the same question: What's he like?\nFirst and foremost, Mitt Romney is a good and honorable man â€” (cheers, applause) â€” committed to public service and his country. (Cheers, applause.) On the morning he took the oath of office, his first act was to focus public attention on those in need. We served breakfast to homeless veterans, encouraging voluntarism and acknowledging the special debt we owe to those who sacrifice for our country. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know, you may not know this, but Mitt Romney never took a salary as governor. (Cheers, applause.) But he worked harder than anyone I know. Every morning, very early, before the rest of us arrived, Mitt would meet with his economic secretary. They worked tirelessly because for Mitt, creating jobs was his top priority. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt was always a hands-on leader. When one of Boston's tunnels collapsed, tragically killing a passenger in her car, Mitt didn't blame others. He dove in and fixed the problem. (Cheers, applause.) Mitt immersed himself in the engineering challenges, personally oversaw safety inspections, abolished cronyism and corruption and restored public confidence. (Cheers, applause.) That's the Mitt Romney I know. And he is ready to bring that same work ethic, vision and integrity to the White House. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt Romney will never let our children's education be second- best or allow their future prosperity to be mortgaged by today's political cowardice.\nHe will respect those who build things with their own minds and their own hands. (Cheers, applause.) And Mitt Romney won't just talk about family values, he will live them every day. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd I'll tell you another thing. Mitt Romney understands that the world is safer when our country leads, and he will never apologize for America. (Cheers, applause.) Mitt Romney will lead us back to an America we can be proud of and ahead to a future where the American dream is alive again, and within every man and woman's reach.\nThank you, Mitt Romney, for believing in America. And America, you can believe in Mitt Romney. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nRAY FERNANDEZ: Thank you. Thank you.\nThese last few months I've heard a lot of false information about Bain Capital and private equity. I'm proud to stand here and tell you what I saw when Bain Capital bought the company where I worked. The experience improved my job, and it gave me opportunities that I always believed were part of the American dream.\nIn 1996 I became a sales rep at a contact lens business called Wesley Jessen. My sales region was right here in Florida, where my parents immigrated from Cuba when I was 13 years old â€” (cheers, applause) â€” from a country where government owns everything, but nothing works. (Cheers, applause.)\nWesley Jessen had been struggling, losing over 50 million (dollars) a year under the previous owner. Then Mitt Romney and Bain Capital came in. Bain Capital saw something others didn't see. They invested money in marketing. They brought in a charismatic and dynamic CEO, Kevin Ryan. They did everything to make the company succeed. This is the real Bain Capital â€” the story the Obama campaign doesn't want you to hear.\nBecause of Bain Capital's attention to management, Wesley Jessen roared back, and workers like me were inspired by what we saw, and our careers thrived.\nAnd when the company went public a few years later, I was well- rewarded. With that money, my wife, Sylvia, who's a pharmacist, and I, started our own business in Hialeah, Florida, Vida Pharmacy. (Cheers, applause.) None of this would have been possible without Bain Capital's investment (that brought ambition ?) and commitment to a struggling company. As a result, we're doing what we love: serving our community. We are building our future.\nStories like this need to be told. My life today is better because of Bain Capital. Mitt Romney helped turn around my company. I can't imagine anyone better-prepared to turn around this country. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nTOM STEMBERG: Twenty-five years ago I had a crazy idea for a new business.\nI wanted to do to office supplies what Home Depot had done with home improvement. I pictured an office superstore for regular customers and small businesses. The business would be called Staples.\nIt wasn't easy at first. I had a vision and a business plan. Then I met Mitt Romney. He helped make it come alive.\nNow, Mitt was an unusual guy. He had already enjoyed great success in Bain & Company. But he knew the value of a dollar. When I told him about Staples, he got really excited at the idea of saving a few cents on paper clips. (Laughter.)\nFunny thing. But I ask you, who would make a better president? Someone who knows how to save a dollar on pens and paper, or someone who knows how to waste $535 million on Solyndra? (Cheers, applause.)\nThe truth â€” the truth is Mitt was not a typical investor. He was a true partner. Where some saw an unproven new business, he saw a store that could save people money. He recognized that efficiency creates consumer value.\nAnd he never looked at Staples merely as a financial investment. He saw the engine of prosperity it would become. Today Staples employs nearly 90,000 people. It has over 2,000 stores, over 50 distribution centers. (Applause.) It is a competitive â€” and it is part of a competitive industry that helps entrepreneurs and small businesses get started on their own. (Cheers, applause.) For me â€” for me, as a founder, it was the realization of a dream.\nSo you can imagine my dismay when I see this White House and their campaign demonizing Mitt Romney, demonizing Bain Capital and demonizing the private equity industry that has created so many new jobs. (Cheers, applause.) Over and over again, fiction, half-truths and downright lies. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, you have to ask yourself, why would an administration that can't create any jobs demonize someone who did? (Laughter, applause.) I've got a theory. I think when it comes to jobs, new businesses and economic growth, they just don't get it. (Cheers, applause.) You know, they say Mitt Romney is out of touch with ordinary Americans. They just don't get it. The night before we opened the first store, I asked our people to do back-to-back all-nighters. That's when I got a phone call from Mitt. He wanted to come over and talk with the team and spend some time with them, and he told me in very clear terms: Tom, this business is all about the people.\nBut this Obama-Biden campaign, they just don't get it. They will tell you that private equity is focused only on the short term. Tell that to the founders of Bright Horizons day care, a company that has transformed corporate day care. Most people didn't give the business a chance. It went five straight years without making a profit, but Mitt and Bain Capital stood by them.\nMitt and Bain Capital believed in the vision, and they understood how important it was for women to join the workforce and have on-site day care for their children. (Cheers, applause.) It was an overdue revolution in the American workplace. Today that company employs over 19,000 people. (Cheers, applause.)\nBut President Obama and his friends, they just don't get it.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (With speaker.) They just don't get it.\nTOM STEMBERG: The Obama campaign will tell you that Bain Capital was a form of \"vampire capitalism,\" draining the blood from a company and move on. They just don't get it.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (With speaker.) They just don't get it.\nTOM STEMBERG: You know, where were they when Mitt stayed with Staples for 15 years, long after Bain Capital had sold its stock? Where were they when Bain Capital helped start Steel Dynamics when most people had given up on the American steel industry? Eighteen years later, that company employs 6,000 people. (Cheers, applause.) But this administration, they just don't get it.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (With speaker.) They just don't get it.\nTOM STEMBERG: You know, they've got a job council that never meets, a Democratic Senate that doesn't act, a president who doesn't believe and a vice president who just can't stop talking. (Laughter, applause.) They just don't get it.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (With speaker.) They just don't get it.\nTOM STEMBERG: And you know, they don't get it because they don't believe in the spirit of the entrepreneur. They don't understand what it means to risk money to create something new.\nAnd they don't understand the hard work it takes to get a business off the ground, the sacrifices you make, the Little League games you miss. They don't see this as a country of opportunity where someone like myself, the son of immigrants, born in Newark, New Jersey â€” and proud of that, Governor Christie â€” (cheers, applause) â€” can live the American dream.\nWell, let me tell you, my friend Mitt Romney gets it. (Cheers, applause.) And I could not be more confident in saying the American people get it. That's why this November they will elect Mitt Romney as the next president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Applause.)\nBOB WHITE: Thank you, thank you. I have a question. I have a question for you. Wasn't Ann Romney spectacular on Tuesday night? (Cheers, applause.) I agree, and Ann had some really great stories about Mitt. And so do I.\nFor 30 years I have been at Mitt Romney's side when he did extraordinary things. As Mitt says, I'm his wingman. I was there when Mitt turned around desperate situations, fixed big, broken things and had a profoundly positive impact on people's lives.\nOur journey began when Mitt asked a small group of us to help him start an investment firm called Bain Capital. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. Mitt was absolutely clear what he expected from each of us. We would act with absolute integrity, mutual respect, true teammates and we would recognize the profound responsibility we owed to those who placed their trust in us. (Cheers, applause.) Integrity, respect, responsibility, trust â€” these are not just words to Mitt Romney.\nThese are principles he lives by. (Cheers, applause.)\nHe also applied them to the way we worked. First, he built a team. He recruited the best people he could find, reached out for ideas, encouraged dissent and fostered real cooperation.\nNext, he gave us a clarity of purpose. Our investors included pension funds, colleges and charities with noble missions. We would invest wisely, and we would treat their money as carefully as we treated our own. We would support entrepreneurs, and we would invest in troubled situations. We would help them grow and try to make their companies better. And we would be held accountable for our performance. And when things went wrong, we would not blame others. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd finally, he took decisive action. Mitt never hesitated. He made tough decisions, coalesced a team and moved forward. Time and time again I have seen this decisive leadership. When our old consulting firm was on the verge of collapse, they asked Mitt to come back and help. He answered the call. When many thought the situation was hopeless, Mitt was not deterred. I'll never forget when he said, Bob, a thousand employees and their family depend on us, and we cannot let them down.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nWhen the obstacles seemed insurmountable and others panicked, Mitt was the calm in the storm, and he never lost hope. His confidence gave us confidence. And that company not only survived, it thrived. And today Bain & Company is recognized as one of the best places to work in America. (Cheers, applause.)\nI saw something similar when Mitt was asked to help save the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. When we first realized the magnitude of the financial and management challenges, I was skeptical whether they could be saved. Mitt never doubted what could be done. He applied the same principles of leadership, and the Olympics became a story that made America proud. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd when Mitt was elected governor of Massachusetts, he asked that I help him assemble a team that would serve the public trust and be loyal to the principles he held dear. That team accomplished so much because they got Republicans and Democrats to focus on the real problems and achieve real results. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo why has Mitt taken so many challenges? It's because he runs towards problems, believes it's important to make a difference and is determined to always give something back.\nIn every pursuit, he feels a sense of responsibility and a commitment to serve.\nEven though we worked endless hours at Bain Capital, Mitt found time to serve his church and counsel people in need. And if someone needed help, Mitt was there.\nWhen our partner's daughter went missing in New York, Mitt said, we can't just stand by and do nothing; we have to go find her. He closed down our entire office, took all of us to Boston, mobilized the search efforts. (cheers, applause) â€” and within days, we found her, and a mom and a dad and a daughter were reunited. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt wanted us to give something back too. He inspired the formation of Bain Capital Children's Charity. It not only donated money to worthy children's causes, it got Bain Capital employees actively involved in their communities.\nGo back and look at every pursuit in Mitt's life. Surrounding him are people who have worked with him over and over again. They trust him, they respect him, they want to be part of his team, and they want to be part of the change. And today we need urgent change in Washington. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd we need â€” we need a proven leader with passion and compassion. I have seen Mitt Romney be that leader. He is the right man at the right time to be the next president of the United States.\nThank you very much. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Applause.)\nTED OPAROWSKY: Evening, folks.\nMy wife and I are people of modest means. I made my living as a professional firefighter for 27 years. (Cheers, applause.) Prior to moving to Randolph, Vermont, we lived in Medford, Massachusetts. (Cheers, applause.) It was there we met Mitt Romney and his family.\nIt's been over 30 years since we have lost our son David. The memories are still vivid and painful. But we wanted to share them with you because David's story is a part of Mitt's story, and America deserves to hear it.\nBack in the early 1970s, Mitt visited our home numerous times, with his oldest son Tagg tagging along. He was in the vanguard of our support system when we received the news that no parent is prepared to confront. You cannot measure a man's character based on the words he utters before adoring crowds during times that are happy. The true measure of a man is revealed in his actions during times of trouble, the quiet hospital room of a dying boy, with no cameras and no reporters.\nThis is the time to make that assessment.\nIn 1979 a tragedy struck our family when our youngest son, David, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, a â€” it was a cancer.\nPAT OPAROWSKY: Over a period of seven months he was in and out of Children's Hospital in Boston for treatment. Throughout that agonizing period, Mitt took time from his busy schedule to visit David. They developed a loving friendship. On one of his visits, Mitt discovered that David was very fond of fireworks. He went out and bought a box full of big-time fireworks that had to sit on the closet shelf because they couldn't be set off in the city. We waited until we were able to go to Ogunquit, Maine, where we set them off on the sand dunes, with permission from the fire and police departments. (Laughter.)\nThrough that simple but thoughtful gift, Mitt brought joy to a young boy who had experienced any â€” had not experienced any for too long. He also gave the rest of us a welcome relief. On another visit, David, knowing Mitt had gone to law school at Harvard, asked Mitt if he would help him write a will. He had some prized possessions he wanted to make sure were given to his closest friends and family.\nThe next time Mitt went to the hospital, he was equipped with his yellow legal pad and pen. Together, they made David's will. That is a task that no child should ever have to do, but it gave David peace of mind.\nSo after David's death, we were able to give his skateboard, his model rockets and his fishing gear to his best friends. He also made it clear that his brother Peter should get his Ruger 22 rifle.\nHow many men do you know would take the time out of their busy lives to visit a terminally ill 14-year-old and help him settle his affairs?\nDavid also helped us plan his funeral. He wanted to be buried in his Boy Scout uniform. He wanted Mitt to pronounce his eulogy, and Mitt was there to honor that request.\nWe will be ever grateful to Mitt for his love and concern. (Cheers, applause.)\nTED OPAROWSKY: We humbly wish that God will continue to bless Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in their efforts. In doing so, he will bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)\nPAM FINLAYSON: In 1982, my husband, Grant, and I moved from California to Massachusetts with our newborn son. Being a church- going family, we looked for the nearest chapel and soon found ourselves in a congregation led by a clearly bright and capable man named Mitt Romney.\nI knew Mitt was special from the start.\nAt the time, we didn't own a dryer, and the day he stopped by to welcome us, I was embarrassed to have laundry hanging all over the house. But Mitt wasn't fazed. In fact, as we spoke, without a word, he joined me and actually started helping, helpfully plucking clothes from around the house and folding them. By the time Mitt left, not only did I feel welcome, my laundry was done. (Laughing.)\nAs Grant and I juggled school, jobs, church and family, we grew to love the Romneys. They became role models and friends, and we were honored when Mitt and Ann regularly trusted us to stay with their five rambunctious but very loving sons when they traveled. It was when our daughter Kate was born three and a half months early, however, that I fully came to appreciate what a great treasure of friendship we had in Mitt and Ann.\nKate was so tiny and very sick, her lungs not yet ready to breathe, her heart unstable. And after suffering a severe brain hemorrhage at three days old, she was teetering on the very edge of life.\nAs I sat with her in intensive care, consumed with a mother's worry and fear, dear Mitt came to visit and pray with me. As our clergy, he was one of very few visitors allowed. And I will never forget how when he looked down tenderly at my daughter, his eyes filled with tears and he reached out and gently stroked her tiny back.\nI could tell immediately that he didn't just see a tangle of plastic in tubes and wires. He saw our beautiful little girl. And he was clearly overcome with compassion for her.\nDuring the many months that our Kate was hospitalized, the Romneys often cared for our 2-year-old son Peter. They treated him like one of their own, like a sick son. They gave him a nickname and even welcomed him to stay the night when needed.\nWhen Thanksgiving rolled around, Kate was still struggling for life. Brain surgery was scheduled, and the holiday was the furthest thing from our minds. But that morning I opened my door to find Mitt and his boys, arms loaded down with a Thanksgiving feast. Of course, we were overcome. When I called to thank Ann later, she sweetly confessed it had been Mitt's idea that most of the shopping and cooking and chopping had been done by him. She and the boys had just happily pitched in.\nEventually we moved from Boston. Our daughter Kate grew into an amazing girl of faith and love. (Cheers, applause.) But complications of her birth remained with her. And after 26 years of both miracles and struggle, she passed away just a year and a half ago.\nIn the midst of making the final decision to run for president, which had to be the most difficult of their lives, when they heard of Kate's passing, both Mitt and Ann paused to personally reach out to us and extend us sympathy and express their love. It seems to me when it comes to loving our neighbor, we can talk about it, or we can live it.\nThe Romneys live it every single day. (Cheers, applause.)\nWhen the world looks at Mitt Romney, they may see him as the founder of a successful business, the leader of the Olympic Games or a governor. But when I see Mitt Romney, I know him to be a loving father, a man of faith and a caring and compassionate friend. It is with great excitement and renewed hope that I think of how our country will be blessed as it is led by a man who is not only so very accomplished and capable, but who has devoted his entire life quietly serving others. That man is Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nGRANT BENNETT: I have been blessed to spend thousands of hours over many years with a dear friend and remarkable man named Mitt Romney. These wonderful, even glorious, hours together were spent in serving our fellow men and women. They were spent in service in our church. (Cheers, applause.) We embraced Christ's admonition, \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" (Cheers, applause.)\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which we are members, has an unpaid lay clergy.\nWhile raising his family and pursuing his career, Mitt Romney served in our church, devoting 10, 15 and even 20 hours a week doing so. Like all Mormon leaders, he did so on his own time and at his own expense. (Cheers, applause.)\nI was Mitt's assistant when he was our pastor. I had a front-row seat, and it was marvelous to behold. As we began working together, Mitt asked, how early can I call you in the morning? I answered, 6:00 a.m. I regret my answer. (Laughter.) Mitt Romney became my alarm clock.\nA typical morning call: Grant, it's Mitt. I'm at the airport. Hazel Young (sp) tripped last night and bruised her hip. Please visit her this evening. Give her my love. I'll arrange for meals, and I will visit her on my way home from the airport tomorrow.\nIn our early morning calls, Mitt didn't discuss questions of theology. He found the definition of religion given by James in the New Testament to be a practical guide. Pure religion is to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo what specifically did Mitt Romney do as our pastor? For one or two evenings each week and several hours every weekend, week after week and year after year, he met with those seeking help with the burdens of real life, burdens we all face at one time or another: unemployment, sickness, financial distress, loneliness.\nMitt prayed and counseled with church members seeking spiritual direction: single mothers raising children, couples with marital problems, youth with addictions, immigrants separated from their families and individuals whose heat had been shut off. To uphold the dignity and respect the privacy of those who came, he met with them in private and in confidence. He has upheld that trust. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt's response to those who came was compassion in all its beautiful varieties. He had a listening ear and a helping hand. Drawing on the skills and resources of those in our congregation, Mitt provided food and housing, rides to the doctor and companions to sit with those who were ill. He shoveled snow and raked leaves for the elderly. He took down tables and swept floors at church dinners. He was often the last to leave.\nYears later I became the pastor.\nOnly then did I understand the dedication this calling requires and the clarity this service provides into the full range of our shared human experience. Mitt challenged each of us to find our life by losing it in service to others. He issued that challenge again and again. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe church itself was a marvelous vehicle for extending that challenge. Mitt seldom delivered the sermon himself; he gave that opportunity to fellow church members. He sought to involve everyone so everyone could grow. Mitt taught faith in God, personal integrity, self-reliance and service to our fellow men. (Applause.) And Mitt did what he challenged us to do; he led by example. (Cheers, applause.)\nI treasure every minute we serve together. I am grateful for my apprenticeship in the things that matter most under the hands of a deeply good man named Mitt Romney.

Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)\nBefore I begin my remarks, I have something personal I'd like to share with you. I've been so blessed to be part of a family that has committed its life to public service. My granddad â€”Â (cheers, applause) â€”Â my grandfather and my father have been incredible role models for me and served our country honorably.\nAnd my brother? Well, I love my brother. (Cheers, applause.) He is a man of integrity, courage and honor. And during incredibly challenging times, he kept us safe. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo Mr. President â€”Â Mr. President, it is time to stop blaming your predecessor for your failed economic policies. (Cheers, applause.) You were dealt a tough hand. You were dealt a tough hand, but your policies have not worked. In the fourth year of your presidency, a real leader would accept responsibility for his actions, and you haven't done it.\nNow â€”Â (cheers, applause) â€”Â now that I've gotten that off of my chest, let's talk a little bit about our kids and education.\nThis election is about the future of this nation. We can shape that future with what we do here, with what we do on November 6th. We can restore America's greatness. That starts with a strong economy, a smart energy policy, lower deficits and a president who puts America's workers and job creators first.\nBut to have a great future, a secure future, a future that is equal to our potential as a nation, we need to do something else.\nWe must make sure that our children and grandchildren are ready for the world we are shaping today. (Cheers, applause.) It starts â€”Â it starts in our homes, in our communities and especially in our schools.\nAs a candidate and governor, I visited over 400 Florida schools. I saw children read for their first sentences, solve their first long division problems, explore the miracles of chemistry and physics. That's the essence of education: students getting a chance at a future.\nThere are many reasons to believe America's future is bright, but also reasons to worry. Of 34 advanced nations in the world, American students rank 17th in science, 25th in math. Only one quarter of high school graduates are ready for their next steps. China and India produce eight times more engineering students each years than the United States. This is a moral cost to our country. Our failing schools need to be fixed. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe say that every child in America has an equal opportunity. But tell that to a kid in whose classroom learning isn't respected. Tell that to a parent stuck in a school where there is no leadership. Tell that to a young talented teacher who just got laid off because she didn't have tenure. The sad truth is that equality of opportunity doesn't exist in many of our schools. We give some kids a chance, but not all. That failure is the great moral and economic issue of our time, and it is hurting all of America. (Cheers, applause.)\nI believe we can meet this challenge. We need to set high standards for students and teachers, and provide students and their parents the choices they deserve.\nThe first step is a simple one. We must stop prejudging children based on their race, ethnicity or household income. (Cheers, applause.) We must stop excusing failure in our schools and start rewarding improvement and success. (Cheers, applause.) We must have high academic standards that are benchmarked to the best in the world.\nYou see, all kids can learn. Governor Romney believes it, and the data proves it. While he was governor, Massachusetts raised standards, and today their students lead the nation in academic performance. (Cheers, applause.)\nHere in Florida, in 1999 we were at the bottom of the nation in education. For the last decade the state has been on a path of reform. Under the leadership of Governor Rick Scott and local leaders, our focus every day is whether students are learning. That's it. (Cheers, applause.)\nToday more students are reading on grade level, passing rigorous college prep courses and graduating from high school. And perhaps most exciting, those traditionally left behind are showing the greatest gains. Among African-American students, Florida is ranked fourth in the nation for academic improvement. Among low-income students â€”Â (cheers, applause) â€”Â we're ranked third for our gains. Among students with disabilities, we're ranked first. And among Latino students â€”Â (cheers, applause) â€”Â the gains were so big they require a new metric. Right now Florida's fourth-grade Hispanic students read as well or better than the average of all students in 21 states and the District of Columbia. (Cheers, applause.)\nThese kids â€”Â these kids were once written off. But today, thanks to teachers like Sean Duffy, we're changing that.\n(Applause.)\nSEAN DUFFY: I'm honored to be an educator, to help the next generation of leaders, thinkers, builders and entrepreneurs. Sadly, I'm part of a dwindling field. I've seen too many good teachers come and go, mainly due to poor working conditions and little pay. Bad teachers get locked into the system, and good teachers leave for more money.\nOn top of the bureaucratic challenges, what we're teaching doesn't always match what our students actually need. To that end, I helped launch a STEM lab at my high school. These labs focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics and help students learn proficiency in these fields.\nWe turn students away from education each year by not providing a robust curriculum that helps keep â€”Â that keeps up with the world in which these students live and will eventually work. And at the end of the day, all of what we do, from the educators to the policymakers, has to be student-focused and student-centered. (Cheers, applause.) After all, students matter most, and that's what counts.\nThank you. (Cheers, applause.)\nJEB BUSH: Thank you, Sean. I know that Del Valle High School is proud of your efforts, and we need more great teachers like you, teachers who don't give up on a kid, who recognize that every child can learn and don't waste a precious year of a student's life. If you're a great teacher and your students are mastering their subjects, no matter your age or years of experience, you should have a job. Education is hard work, but if you follow some core principles and you challenge the status quo, you can get great results.\nSo here's another thing we could do: Let's give every parent in America a choice about where their child's â€”Â (cheers, applause) â€”Â attends school.\nLook â€”Â (cheers, applause) â€”Â everywhere in our lives, we get a chance to choose. Go down any supermarket aisle, and you'll find an incredible selection of milk. You can get whole milk, buttermilk, 2 percent milk, lowfat milk or skim milk, organic milk and milk with extra vitamin D. There's flavored milk, chocolate, strawberry or vanilla, and it doesn't even taste like milk. They even make milk for people who can't drink milk. (Laughter.) So my question to you is shouldn't parents have that kind of choice in schools that best meets the needs of their students? (Cheers, applause.)\nGovernor Romney gets it. Mitt Romney gets it. He believes parents, regardless of zip code or income, should be able to send their child to the school that fits them best. That has set him up against some entrenched interests. There are many people who say they support strong schools but draw the line at school choice. Sorry, kid, giving you equal opportunity would be too risky, and it would upset powerful political forces that we need to win elections. I have a simple message for these masters of delay and deferral: Choose. You can either help the politically powerful unions, or you can help the kids. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, for those that have been involved in this, you know it's hard to take on the unions. They fund campaigns. They're well- organized. Election day, they'll show up.\nMeanwhile, the kids aren't old enough to vote. But you and I know who deserves a choice. Governor Romney knows it, too.\nLet me introduce you to Frantz Placide. Because we gave him a choice, he got a great election. (Cheers, applause.)\nFRANTZ PLACIDE: I grew up in the inner city of Miami, in a place where your ZIP code determines your chances of success. My only option was an unproductive and failing school. I knew that could lead to an unproductive and failing future.\nThank to Governor Bush's school choice program, I got the chance to choose a better school. Making my education my priority, I enrolled at one of the toughest high schools in Miami, Archbishop Curley Notre Dame. (Cheers, applause.)\nI'm sure, like a lot of us, it was my mother Carlette (sp) who really pushed for a choice in my education. I'm glad she did. Her devotion to my future has given me a chance to succeed. I've graduated from Wagner College, and I'm looking forward to a life of learning and serving my community. (Cheers, applause.)\nWho knows what the future would have held if I didn't have a choice in my education? But I do know the numbers for failure, and I probably wouldn't have a good chance.\nGovernor Bush's school choice program gave me a chance to achieve academic success in a school that was best-fit for me. I took it from there. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)\nJEB BUSH: Thank you, Frantz. It is an incredible honor to see you grow up. And Frantz's story is â€”Â and many others â€”Â is a driving force across this nation to bring about necessary change.\nAnd some of the biggest reformers are Republicans. Governor Mitch Daniels in Indiana and Bobby Jindal in Louisiana have expanded school choice from what we have here in Florida. (Cheers, applause.) Governor Martinez in New Mexico is raising expectations, holding schools accountable for students gaining critical reading skills. Governor LePage in Maine and Deal in Georgia are transforming education by pushing schools to harness the power of technology and digital learning. (Cheers.) Idaho Governor Otter and Superintendent Luna are raising up the best teachers â€”Â (cheers) â€”Â and separating out the ineffective ones. That earned them some enemies. Some of them slashed the superintendent's tires. But he didn't back down. (Applause.)\nGovernor Scott Walker in Wisconsin led his state â€”Â (cheers, applause) â€”Â Governor Walker led his state to adopt reforms that promote early literacy and require that teacher evaluations incorporate student achievement. In Nevada, Governor Sandoval pushed for reforms to end the damaging practice of \"last in, first out,\" where teachers are hired or fired based on their years in the system, not their impact in the classroom. Governor Haslam in Tennessee is making sure every classroom has an effective teacher. (Cheers, applause.)\nBecause he is a former governor, Mitt Romney understands that states must lead this national movement. In Massachusetts â€”Â (cheers, applause) â€”Â Governor Romney narrowed the gap between students of different races, raised testing standards and put into place a merit scholarship â€”Â The John and Abigail Adams Scholarship â€”Â to give students four tuition-free years at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning. (Cheers, applause.) He is a champion for bringing hope to education, and he intends to be a champion for equality of opportunity â€”Â a president who always puts students first.\nSo in this election, remember this: Our future as a nation is at stake. Fact is this election is not just about one office; it's about one nation. If we want to continue to be the greatest nation on the planet, we must give our kids what we promise them: an equal opportunity. That starts in the classroom. It starts in our communities. It starts where you live. And it starts with electing Mitt Romney the next president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you. God bless you. God bless our excellent teachers, and God bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nCRAIG ROMNEY: I am honored and humbled to speak to you tonight. I'm incredibly proud of my father, and I love him dearly.\nIt is my privilege to say a few words in Spanish, so please bear with me for a moment. Buenas noches. Es un placer estar con ustedes. Yo pase dos anios (ph) viviendo y trabajando en Chile. A traves de esa experiencia â€”Â (inaudible) â€”Â aun mas como hispanos han aportado a la diversa riqueza de los Estados Unidos.\nMi padre, Mitt Romney, es un hombre de familia. El es un gran esposo, padre y abuelo. El sabe como unir a nuestro pais y valora que somos una nacion de inmigrantes unidos en el deseo de lograr el suenio (ph) americano. El ama a nuestra nacion. El luchara para confrontar los retos que tenemos y restaurar la grandeza de los Estados Unidos.\nIt's easy to forget â€”Â (cheers) â€”Â thank you. (Cheers, applause.) It's easy to forget that the story of my father's success begins with the story of two immigrants. Thank you.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nMy grandfathers, who came to this country with little more than hope and the opportunity of America, through their hard work and perseverance, they lived the American dream. They gave opportunities to their children they wouldn't have had anywhere else. The Republican Party is dedicated to preserving that opportunity for all Americans. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe've had the privilege of hearing about different chapters of the same inspiring story from Governors Sandoval and Martinez and soon-to-be Senator Cruz. We're seeing this story play out in the lives of many other Hispanic-Americans who have become leaders in the Republican party and throughout our nation. These leaders, along with Hispanics across the country, play a vital role in the Romney-Ryan comeback as we fight to put America back on the path to prosperity.\nThank you. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nCALLISTA GINGRICH: Thank you. Thank you for that warm welcome. What a wonderful tribute to President Reagan and the spirit of the American people.\nNEWT GINGRICH: It's fantastic to see so many friends here, friends from decades of service to the party, service in public life and those who have helped us over the past few years. And we are delighted that tonight we come together to once again renew the American spirit and put real leadership back in the White House this November.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nCALLISTA GINGRICH: The election of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will decisively move America to a better future. Remembering President Reagan reminds us that the choices we make matter. And this year is as important as the choice we made in 1980.\nNEWT GINGRICH: Over three decades have passed since Ronald Reagan was first elected to the White House. Yet the impact of his leadership is still evident today. While in office, President Reagan had three major goals: to restore the economy, to revive the American spirit and to defeat totalitarianism, spreading democracy throughout the world.\nCALLISTA GINGRICH: By remaining true to his convictions through his belief in the American people and with tremendous optimism, President Reagan achieved these goals.\nNEWT GINGRICH: It's striking how President Carter and President Obama both took our nation down a path that in four years weakened America's confidence in itself and our hope for a better future.\nCALLISTA GINGRICH: Both weakened the respect for America abroad. Both increased government programs filled with waste and inefficiency that failed to produce results. Both made promises they couldn't keep. And as a consequence of ineffective policies, both were unable to revive our economy and create jobs.\nNEWT GINGRICH: For example, both crippled American energy production when there were better ways to develop and use our abundant energy resources.\nThe Romney plan for North American energy independence is exactly the kind of bold visionary leadership Reagan believed in, and it is what we need now. (Cheers, applause.)\nCALLISTA GINGRICH: The Reagan presidency also teaches us that there is a better way to put Americans back to work, create millions of jobs and help every American achieve success. The Reagan program of tax cuts, regulatory reform and spending controls worked.\nNEWT GINGRICH: Reagan's belief in small business owners and entrepreneurs is a remarkable contrast with Obama's class warfare rhetoric, massive deficits and a passion for taxing those who create jobs. The Romney plan for a stronger middle class has deep roots in Ronald Reagan's approach.\nCALLISTA GINGRICH: Reagan's commitment to reform welfare and to create a work requirement was a major achievement when he was governor of California. His pioneering work led to the historic welfare reform bill Congress and the president passed 30 years later. This bipartisan legislation reduced the size of government, made our country more competitive and put millions of Americans back to work. (Cheers, applause.)\nNEWT GINGRICH: Tragically, President Obama gutted this achievement, and like Jimmy Carter, over four years he produced little effective legislation that brought the two parties together in the interest of the nation.\nObama's waiving of the work requirements in welfare reform is just one example of his direct repudiation of President Reagan's values.\nObama's proud of what he's done, and of his politically motivated partisanship. But he should be ashamed for putting politics before people. (Cheers, applause.)\nCALLISTA GINGRICH: Governor Romney will return America to work and to the principles that are at the core of President Reagan's legacy. This year the American people will once again have an important choice to make.\nNEWT GINGRICH: Now each of us must commit ourselves, in the tradition of Ronald Reagan, to come together. President Reagan said there is no substitute for victory. And this November we cannot settle for anything less. This â€”Â (cheers, applause) â€”Â this is the most critical election of our lifetime. Each of us must do our part now to ensure that America remains, in the tradition of President Reagan, a land of freedom, hope and opportunity.\nThank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\CONNIE MACK: Once again it's morning in America.\nThere are new leaders on the horizon: Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, America's comeback team. (Cheers, applause.)\nGrowing up, I had a plaque on my wall that read: Life's battles don't always go to the fastest or the strongest. Sooner or later those who win are those who think they can. We've always been a people with big dreams and limitless potential. After all, this is America. (Cheers, applause.)\nOur success is built on our values and our principles. But so many of them are under attack. Our commitment to freedom and liberty and to everything that makes our country great seems to embarrass the \"blame America first\" crowd. They penalize individual achievement, praising the power of government, but they have not, cannot and will not destroy our spirit. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe are proud to be Americans, we are proud of our nation, we are proud of our heritage, and we are proud of our success. It is our commitment to the American story. It's our athletes in London who brought home more medals than any other country, even China. (Cheers, applause.) It's our best and our brightest who landed an extraordinary rover on Mars. It's Nobel Prize winners, scientists, writers, artists second to none who inspire us all. These are the achievements that are brought about by a free society that honors individual effort.\nWe owe it to those who have given so much to regain our strength and remain the strongest force for freedom the world has ever seen.\nOur allies deserve an unwavering support. And our enemies need to know we stand to defend freedom at all costs. (Cheers, applause.)\nAmerica was built on the belief in free enterprise, hard work, passion and faith. We have the awesome responsibility to make that dream a reality. That dream is not an impossible dream. It's the American dream. It's sure, it's strong and it's steady.\nMitt Romney's plans to restore America's promise and purpose will be realized, and the American dream will once again be available to all her children. We are a nation of dreamers â€”Â Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, the Wright Brothers, dreamers like Neil Armstrong who sought new lands and took giant leaps into American exceptionalism, and dreamers like my friend Kiko Villalon. You know the stories of the other. Now let me tell you the story of Kiko.\nIn 1960, Kiko fled Castro's Cuba. He came to New York. He became a taxi driver. He worked hard and saved his money. He became a citizen. He moved to Florida. He started a business building boats. He raised a family. He put his children through school. He sold his business. Now he worries about what opportunities lie ahead for his children and their children.\nKiko has lived the American dream, as have so many others.\nThat's what this election is all about: making the American dream a reality again. (Cheers, applause.)\nIt's not about the past. It's not about what was done wrong. It's not about blaming America. It's quite the opposite. Tonight we embark on a renewal of the American dream. Tonight we honor those who have come before and done so much, many even giving their lives. And tonight we honor our children and their children, to ensure their dreams, whether it's playing under the lights or starting a business or being a doctor or a nurse or a soldier or a sailor or even a president or vice president. Dreams can come â€”Â become realities. After all, this is America, and it's morning once again.\nThank you. (Cheers, applause.) God bless America. God bless you. Thank you. I love you, Florida! (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nPAUL RYAN: Hello, everybody. Hello, everybody. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you. Hey, Wisconsin. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.) (Chuckles.) You guys are great. Thanks so much. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.\nMr. Chairman â€”Â Mr. Chairman, delegates and fellow citizens, I am honored by the support of this convention for vice president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nI accept the duty to help lead our nation out of a jobs crisis and back to prosperity. And I know we can do this. (Cheers, applause.)\nI accept the calling of my generation to give our children the America that was given to us, with opportunity for the young and security for the old. And I know that we are ready. Our nominee is sure ready. (Cheers, applause.) His whole life â€”Â his whole life prepared him for this moment, to meet serious challenges in a serious way, without excuses and idle words. After four years of getting the runaround, America needs a turnaround. And the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nI'm the newcomer to this campaign. So let me share a first impression. I have never seen opponents so silent about their record and so desperate to keep their power. They've run out of ideas. Their moment came and went. Fear and division is all they've got left. With all their attack ads, the president is just throwing away money. And he's pretty experienced at that. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou see, some people can't be dragged down by the usual cheap tactics because their character, ability and plain decency are so obvious.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nFor my part, your nomination is an unexpected turn. It certainly came as news to my family. (Laughter.) And I'd like you to meet them: my best friend and wife, Janna, our daughter Liza, and our boys Charlie and Sam. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe kids are happy to see their grandma who lives in Florida. There she is, my mom Betty. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy dad, a small-town lawyer, was also named Paul. Until we lost him when I was 16, he was a gentle presence in my life. I'd like to think he'd be proud of me and my sister and brothers. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know what? I'm sure proud of him and where I come from: Janesville, Wisconsin. (Cheers, applause.)\nI live on the same block where I grew up. We belong to the same parish where I was baptized. Janesville is that kind of place. The people of Wisconsin have been good to me. I've tried to live up to their trust. And now, I ask those hardworking men and women and millions like them across America to join our cause and get this country working again.\n(Cheers, applause.) When Governor Romney asked me to join the ticket, I said, let's get this done, and that is exactly what we are going to do. (Cheers, applause.)\nPresident Barack Obama came to office during an economic crisis, as he has reminded us a time or two. (Laughter.) Those were very tough days, and any fair measure of his record has to take that into account. My own state voted for President Obama. When he talked about change, many people liked the sound of it, especially in Janesville, where we were about to lose a major factory. A lot of guys I went to high school with worked at that GM plant. Right there at that plant, Candidate Obama said, I believe that if our government is there to support you, this plant will be here for another hundred years. That's what he said in 2008.\nWell, as it turned out, that plant didn't last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day. And that's how it is in so many towns, where the recovery that was promised is nowhere in sight. Right now, 23 million men and women are struggling to find work, 23 million people unemployed or underemployed. Nearly 1-in-6 Americans is in poverty.\nMillions of young Americans have graduated from college during the Obama presidency, ready to use their gifts and get moving in life. Half of them can't find the work they studied for or any work at all. So here's the question: Without a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years? (Cheers, applause.)\nThe first troubling sign came with the stimulus. It was President Obama's first and best shot at fixing the economy at a time when he got â€”Â he got everything he wanted under one-party rule. It cost $831 billion, the largest one-time expenditure every by our federal government. It went to companies like Solyndra, with their gold-plated connections, subsidized jobs and make-believe markets. The stimulus was a case of political patronage, corporate welfare and cronyism at their worst.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: That's right. (Cheers, applause.)\nPAUL RYAN: You, you the American people of this country, were cut out of the deal. What did taxpayers get out of the Obama stimulus? More debt. That money wasn't just spent and wasted. It was borrowed, spent and wasted. (Cheers, applause.)\nMaybe the greatest waste of all was time.\nHere we were, faced with a massive job crisis so deep that if everyone out of work stood in single file, that unemployment line would stretch the length of the entire American continent. You would think that any president, whatever his party, would make job creation and nothing else his first order of economic business. But this president didn't do that. Instead we got a long, divisive, all-or- nothing attempt to put the federal government in charge of health care. (Boos.) \"Obamacare\" comes to more than 2,000 pages of rules, mandates, taxes, fees and fines that have no place in a free country. (Extended cheers, applause.) That's right. That's right. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know what, the president has declared that the debate over government-controlled health care is over. That will come as news to the millions of Americans who will elect Mitt Romney so we can repeal \"Obamacare.\" (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd the biggest, coldest power play of all in \"Obamacare\" came at the expense of the elderly. You see, even with all the hidden taxes to pay for the health care takeover, even with the new law and new taxes on nearly a small businesses, the planners in Washington still didn't have enough money. They needed more. They needed hundreds of billions more. So they just took it all away from Medicare â€”Â $716 billion funneled out of Medicare by President Obama. (Boos.) An obligation we have to our parents and grandparents is being sacrificed all to pay for anew entitlement we didn't even ask for. (Applause.)\nThe greatest threat to Medicare is \"Obamacare,\" and we're going to stop it. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn Congress, when they take out the heavy books and the wall charts about Medicare, my thoughts go back to a house on Garfield Street in Janesville. My wonderful grandma, Janet (sp), had Alzheimer's, and she moved in with Mom and me. Though she felt lost at times, we did all the little things that made her feel loved. We had help from Medicare, and it was there, just like it's there for my mom today. Medicare is a promise, and we will honor it. A Romney- Ryan administration will protect and strengthen Medicare for my mom's generation, for my generation and for my kids and yours. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo our opponents can consider themselves on notice. In this election, on this issue, the usual posturing on the left isn't going to work. Mitt Romney and I know the difference between protecting a program and raiding it. Ladies and gentlemen, our nation needs this debate. We want this debate. We will win this debate! (Cheers, applause.)\n\"Obamacare,\" as much as anything else, explains why a presidency that we â€”Â that began with such anticipation now comes to such a disappointing close. It began with a financial crisis. It ends with a job crisis. It began with a housing crisis they alone didn't cause. It ends with a housing crisis they didn't correct. (Cheers, applause.) It began with a perfect AAA credit rating for the United States. It ends with a downgraded America. (Boos.)\nIt all started off with stirring speeches, Greek columns, the thrill of something new. Now all that's left is a presidency adrift, surviving on slogans that already seem tired, grasping at a moment that has already passed, like a ship trying to sail on yesterday's wind. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know, President Obama was asked not long ago to reflect on any mistakes he might have made. He said, well, I haven't communicated enough. (Laughter.) He said his job is to, quote, tell a story to the American people, as if that's the whole problem here. (Laughter.) He needs to talk more, and we need to be better listeners? (Laughter, cheers, applause.) Ladies and gentlemen, these past four years we have suffered no shortage of words in the White House. What is missing is leadership in the White House. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd the story â€”Â and the story that Barack Obama does tell, forever shifting blame to the last administration, is getting old.\n(Cheers, applause.) The man assumed office almost four years ago. Isn't it about time he assumed responsibility? (Cheers, applause.) Yeah. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn this generation, a defining responsibility of government is to steer our nation clear of a debt crisis while there is still time. Back in 2008 Candidate Obama called a $10 trillion national debt unpatriotic â€”Â serious talk from what looked like a serious reformer. Yet by his own decisions, President Obama has added more debt than any other president before him and more than all the troubled governments of Europe combined. One president, one term, 5 trillion (dollars) in new debt. (Boos.)\nHe created a new bipartisan debt commission. They came back with an urgent report. He thanked them, sent them on their way and then did exactly nothing. (Boos.) Republicans â€”Â Republicans stepped up with good faith reforms and solutions equal to the problems. How did the president respond? By doing nothing â€”Â nothing except to dodge and demagogue the issue. So here we are, $16 trillion in debt, and still he does nothing. In Europe massive debts have put entire governments at risk of collapse, and still he does nothing. And all we have heard from this president and his team are attacks on anyone who dares to point out the obvious. They have no answer to this simple reality.\nWe need to stop spending money we don't have. (Cheers, applause.) Really simple. Not that hard. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy dad used to say to me, son, you have a choice. You can be part of the problem, or you can be part of the solution. The present administration has made its choices, and Mitt Romney and I have made ours. Before the math and the momentum overwhelm us all, we are going to solve this nation's economic problems. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd I'm going to level with you: we don't have that much time. But if we are serious and smart, and we lead, we can do this. After four years of government trying to divide up the wealth, we will get America creating wealth again. (Cheers, applause.) With tax fairness and regulatory reform, we'll put government back on the side of men and women who create jobs and the men and women who need jobs.\nMy mom started a small business, and I've seen what it takes. Mom was 50 when my dad died. She got on a bus every weekday for years and rode 40 miles each morning to Madison.\nShe earned a new degree and learned new skills to start her small business. It wasn't just a new livelihood; it was a new life. And it transformed my mom from a widow in grief to a small-business woman whose happiness wasn't just in the past. Her work gave her hope. It made our family proud. And to this day my mom is my role model. (Cheers, applause.)\nBehind every small business, there's a story worth knowing. All the corner shops in our towns and cities, the restaurants, cleaners, gyms, hair salons, hardware stores â€”Â these didn't come out of nowhere. A lot of heart goes into each one. And if small-business people say they made it on their own, all they are saying is that nobody else works seven days a week in their place. Nobody showed up in their place to open the door at 5:00 in the morning. Nobody did their thinking and worrying and sweating for them.\nAfter all that work and in a bad economy, it sure doesn't help to hear from their president that government gets the credit. What they deserve to hear is the truth: Yes, you did build that. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe have a plan for a stronger middle class, with a goal of generating 12 million new jobs over the next four years. (Applause.) In a clean break â€”Â in a clean break from the Obama years, and frankly, from the years before this president, we will keep federal spending at 20 percent of GDP or less, because that is enough. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe choice â€”Â the choice is whether to put hard limits on economic growth or hard limits on the size of government, and we choose to limit government. (Cheers, applause.)\nI learned a good deal about economics and about America from the author of the Reagan tax reforms, the great Jack Kemp. (Cheers, applause.) What gave Jack that incredible enthusiasm was his belief in the possibilities of free people and the power of free enterprise and strong communities to overcome poverty and despair. We need that same optimism right now.\nAnd in our dealings with other nations, a Romney-Ryan administration will speak with confidence and clarity. Whenever men and women rise up for their own freedom, they will know that the American president is on their side. (Cheers, applause.)\nInstead â€”Â instead of managing American decline, leaving allies to doubt us and adversaries to test us, we will act in the conviction that the United States is still the greatest force for peace and liberty that this world has ever known. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nPAUL RYAN: President Obama is the kind of politician who puts promises on the record and then (calls ?) back the record. (Laughter.) But we are four years into this presidency. The issue is not the economy that Barack Obama inherited, not the economy that he envisions but this economy that we are living. (Cheers, applause.)\nCollege graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life. (Cheers, applause.)\nEveryone â€”Â everyone who feels stuck in the Obama economy is right to focus on the here and now.\nAnd I hope you understand this too. If you're feeling left out or passed by, you have not failed. Your leaders have failed you. (Cheers, applause.) None of us â€”Â none of us should have to settle for the best this administration offers: a dull, adventureless journey from one entitlement to the next; a government-planned life; a country where everything is free but us. (Cheers, applause.)\nListen to the way we're already spoken to. (Cheers, applause.) Listen to the way we are spoken to already, as if everyone is stuck in some class or station in life, victims of circumstances beyond our control, with the government there to help us cope with our fate. It's the exact opposite of everything I learned growing up in Wisconsin or at college in Ohio. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know, when I was waiting tables, washing dishes or mowing lawns for money, I never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life. I was on my own path, my own journey, an American journey, where I could think for myself, decide for myself, define happiness for myself. That's what we do in this country. (Cheers, applause.) That's the American dream. (Cheers, applause.) That's freedom, and I'll take it any day over the supervision and sanctimony of the central planners. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA! USA!\nPAUL RYAN: By themselves â€”Â by themselves, the failures of one administration are not a mandate for a new administration.\nA challenger must stand on his own merits. He must be ready and worthy to serve in the office of president. We're a full generation apart, Governor Romney and I, and in some ways we're different. There are the songs on his iPod, which I've heard on the campaign bus â€”Â (laughter) â€”Â and I've heard it on many hotel elevators. (Laughter, applause.) He actually â€”Â he actually urged me to play some of these songs at campaign rallies. I said, look, I hope it's not a dealbreaker, Mitt â€”Â (laughter) â€”Â but my playlist, it starts with AC/DC and it ends with Zeppelin. (Cheers, applause.)\nLook, a generation apart â€”Â a generation apart, but that doesn't matter. It makes us different, but not in any of the things that matter. Mitt Romney and I both grew up in the heartland, and we know what places like Wisconsin and Michigan look like â€”Â (cheers) â€”Â when times are good. (Cheers, applause.) We know what these communities look like when times are good, when people are working, when families are doing more than just getting by. And we know it can be that way again.\nWe've had very different careers, mine mainly in public services, his mostly in the private sector. He helped start businesses and turn around failing ones. And by the way, being successful in business, that's a good thing. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt â€”Â Mitt has not only succeeded, but he succeeded where others could not. He turned around the Olympics at a time when a great institution was collapsing under the weight of bad management, overspending and corruption. Sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it? (Laughter.) He was a Republican governor of a state where almost 9- in-10 legislators are Democrats. And yet he balanced the budget without raising taxes. (Cheers, applause.) Unemployment went down. Household incomes went up. And Massachusetts under Governor Mitt Romney saw its credit rating upgraded. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt and I also go to different churches. But in any church, the best kind of preaching is done by example. And I've been watching that example. (Cheers, applause.) The man who will accept your nomination tomorrow is prayerful and faithful and honorable. Not only a defender of marriage, he â€”Â he offers an example of marriage at its best. (Cheers, applause.) Not only a fine businessman, he's a fine man â€”Â (cheers, applause) â€”Â worthy of leading this optimistic and good-hearted country.\nOur faiths come together in the same moral creed. We believe that in every life, there is goodness; for every person, there is hope. Each one of us was made for a reason, bearing the image and likeness of the lord of life. (Cheers, applause)\nWe have responsibilities, one to another. We do not each face the world alone. And the greatest of all responsibilities is that of the strong to protect the weak. The truest measure of any society is how it treats those who cannot defend or care for themselves. (Cheers, applause.)\nEach of these moral ideas â€”Â each of these moral ideas is essential to democratic government, to the rule of law, to life in a humane and decent society. They are the moral creed of our country, as powerful in our time as on the day of America's founding. They are self-evident and unchanging. And sometimes even presidents need reminding that our rights come from nature and God and not from government! (Cheers, applause.)\nThe founding generation secured those rights for us. And in every generation since, the best among us have defended our freedoms. They are protecting us right now. We honor them and all of our veterans, and we thank them. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe right that makes all the difference now is the right to choose our own leaders. And you are entitled to the clearest possible choice, because the time for choosing is drawing near.\nSo here is our pledge. We will not duck the tough issues. We will lead. We will not spend four years blaming others. We will take responsibility. (Applause.) We will not try to replace our founding principles. We will reapply our founding principles. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe work ahead will be hard. These times demand the best of all of us â€”Â all of us, but we can do this. We can do this. Together we can do this. We can get this country working again. We can get this economy growing again. (Cheers, applause.) We can make the safety safe again. (Cheers, applause.) We can do this. Whatever your political party, let's come together for the sake of our country. Join Mitt Romney and me. (Cheers, applause.) Let's give this effort everything we have. (Cheers, applause.) Let's see this thing all the way through. Let's get this done. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you, and God bless you all. Thank you. (Cheers, applause continue.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nSUSANA MARTINEZ: Thank you, and good evening. Before I begin tonight, let's keep in our prayers the families impacted by the storm affecting the Gulf Coast. If you haven't done so already, please donate to the Red Cross. To find out more about how you can help those affected by Hurricane Isaac, please visit redcross.org/give.\nI am Susana Martinez. On behalf of the great state of New Mexico, let me express my gratitude for being invited to speak tonight. Growing up, I never imagined a little girl from a border town could one day become a governor. But this is America. En America, todo es posible. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy parents taught me to never give up and to always believe that my future could be whatever I dreamt it to be. Success, they taught me, is built on the foundation of courage, hard work and individual responsibility. Despite what some would have us believe, success is not built on resentment and fear. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe grew up on the border and truly lived paycheck to paycheck. My dad was a Golden Gloves boxer in the Marine Corps, then a deputy sheriff. (Cheers.) My mom worked as an office assistant. One day they decided to start a security guard business. I thought they were absolutely crazy. We literally had no savings. But they always believed in the American dream. (Cheers, applause.) So my dad worked to grow the business. My mom did the books at night. And at 18 I guarded the parking lot at the Catholic church bingoes. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) Now, my dad made sure I could take care of myself. I carried a Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum. (Cheers, applause.) Yes, that gun weighed more than I did. (Laughter.)\nMy parents grew that small business from one 18-year-old guarding a bingo to more than 125 employees in three states. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd sure, there was help along the way. But my parents took the risk. They stood up. And you better believe they built it. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy parents also taught me about having the courage to stand for something. So I went to law school and I became a prosecutor. I took on a speciality that very few choose to pursue. I prosecuted child abuse and child homicide cases â€”Â cases that were truly gut-wrenching. But standing up for those kids, being their voice for justice, was the honor of a lifetime. (Cheers, applause.)\nSometimes you pay a price for standing up. When I was a young prosecutor, I got called to testify against my boss. I could have backed down, but I didn't. I stood up to him. And he fired me for it. So I took him on, ran against him for district attorney and beat him by a landslide. (Cheers, applause.)\nI fear some of our leaders today have lost the courage to stand up. That we have now â€”Â what we have now are politicians. They won't offer real plans, and only stand up when they want to blame someone else. And I don't say that just because a Democrat is in the White House.\nI was a Democrat for many years. So were my parents.\nBefore I ran for district attorney, two Republicans invited my husband and me to lunch, and I knew a party switch was exactly what they wanted. So I told Chuck, we'll be polite, enjoy a free lunch and then say goodbye. But we talked about issues. They never used the words \"Republican\" or \"Democrat,\" \"conservative\" or \"liberal.\" We talked about many issues, like welfare. Is it a way of life or a hand up? Talked about the size of government. How much should it tax families and small businesses? And when we left that lunch, we got in the car, and I looked over at Chuck and said, I'll be damned; we're Republicans. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis election should not be about political parties. Too many Americans are out of work, and our debt is out of control. This election needs to be about those issues. And it is the responsibility of both parties to offer up real solutions and have an honest debate. In New Mexico, I inherited the largest structural deficit in state history. And our legislature is controlled by Democrats. We don't always agree, but we came together in a bipartisan manner and turned that deficit into a surplus.\n(Cheers, applause.) And we did it without raising taxes. (Cheers, applause.) But that's not the kind of leadership that we are seeing from President Obama. He promised to bring us all together, to cut unemployment, to pass immigration reform in his first year and even promised to cut the deficit in half in his first term. Do you remember that?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah!\nSUSANA MARTINEZ: But he hasn't come close. They haven't even passed a budget in Washington, D.C. in three years. (Boos.) If he can take credit for government building small businesses, then he can accept responsibility for breaking his promise and adding $5 trillion to the national debt â€”Â (applause) â€”Â because he did build that. (Cheers, applause.)\nAs the first Hispanic female governor in the history, little girls, they often come up to me in the grocery store or in the mall. They look, and they point, and when they get the courage to come up, they ask, are you Susana? And they run up and they give me a hug. And I wonder, how do you know who I am?\nBut they do, and these are little girls.\nIt's in moments like these when I'm reminded that we each pave a path, and for me, it's about paving a path for those little girls to follow. They need to know: No more barriers. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn many ways, Mitt Romney and I are very different â€”Â different starts in life, different paths to leadership, different cultures. But we've each shared in the promise of America. And we share a core belief that the promise of America must be kept for the next generation. \"El sueno americano es tener exito.\" (Cheers, applause.) Is success â€”Â it is success, and success is the American dream. And that success is not something to be ashamed of or to demonize.\nThere is one candidate in this election who will protect that dream, one leader who will fight hard to keep the promise of America for the next generation. And that's why we must stand up and make Mitt Romney the next president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nCONDOLEEZZA RICE: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Condi!\nCONDOLEEZZA RICE: Thank you so much. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening, distinguished delegates. Good evening, fellow Republicans.\nGood evening, my fellow Americans. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe gather here at a time of significance and challenge. This young century has been a difficult one. I can remember as if it were yesterday when my young assistant came into my office at the White House to say that a plane had hit the World Trade Center, and then a second plane, and then a third plane, the Pentagon. And later we would learn that a plane had crashed into a field in Pennsylvania, driven into the ground by brave souls who died so that others might live. (Cheers, applause.) From that day on â€”Â from that day on, our sense of vulnerability and our concepts of security were never the same again.\nThen in 2008 the global financial and economic crisis would stun us. And it still reverberates as we deal with unemployment and economic uncertainty and bad policies that cast a pall over an American economy and a recovery that is desperately needed at home and abroad. (Applause.)\nAnd we have seen â€”Â we have seen that the desire for liberty and freedom is indeed universal, as men and women in the Middle East rise up to seize it. Yet the promise of the Arab Spring is engulfed in uncertainty. Internal strife and hostile neighbors are challenging the young, fragile democracy of Iraq. Dictators in Iran and Syria butcher their people and threaten regional security. Russia and China prevent a response. And everyone asks: Where does America stand?\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah! (Applause.)\nCONDOLEEZZA RICE: Indeed â€”Â indeed, that is the question of the hour. Where does America stand? You see, when friends or foes alike don't know the answer to that question unambiguously and clearly, the world is likely to be a more dangerous and chaotic place.\nSince World War II, the United States has had an answer to that question. We stand for free people and free markets. We will defend and support them. (Cheers, applause.) We will sustain a balance of power that favors freedom.\nNow to be sure, the burdens of leadership have been heavy. I know, as you do, the sacrifice of Americans, especially the sacrifice of many of our bravest in the ultimate sacrifice. But our armed forces are the sure shield and foundation of liberty, and we are so fortunate that we have men and women in uniform who volunteer. They volunteer to defend us at the front lines of freedom, and we owe them our eternal gratitude. (Cheers, applause.)\nI know too that it has not always been easy, though it has been rewarding, to speak for those who would otherwise not have a voice: the religious dissident in China, the democracy advocate in Venezuela, the political prisoner in Iran.\nIt has been hard to muster the resources to support fledgling democracies and to intervene on behalf of the most desperate: the AIDS orphan in Uganda, the refugee fleeing Zimbabwe, the young woman who has been trafficked into the sex trade in Southeast Asia. It has been hard. Yet this assistance, together with the compassionate work of private charities, people of conscience and people of faith, have shown the soul of our country.\nAnd I know, too â€”Â (applause) â€”Â I know, too, that there is a weariness. I know that it feels as if we have carried these burdens long enough. But we can only know that there is no choice, because one of two things will happen if we don't lead. Either no one will lead and there will be chaos, or someone will fill the vacuum who does not share our values. My fellow Americans, we do not have a choice. We cannot be reluctant to lead, and you cannot lead from behind. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt Romney and Paul Ryan understand this reality. Our well- being at home and our leadership abroad are inextricably linked. They know what to do. They know that our friends and allies must again be able to trust us. From Israel to Colombia, from Poland to the Philippines, our allies and friends have to know that we will be reliable and consistent and determined. And our foes â€”Â our foes can have no reason to doubt our resolve because peace really does come through strength. (Cheers, applause.)\nOur military capability and our technological advantage will be safe in Mitt Romney's hands. We must work for an open global economy and pursue free and fair trade to grow our exports and our influence abroad.\nIf you are worried about the rise of China, just consider this. The United States has negotiated â€”Â the United States has ratified only three trade agreements in the last few years, and those were negotiated in the Bush administration. (Cheers, applause.) China â€”Â China has signed 15 free trade agreements and is in the progress (sic; process) of negotiating as many as 18 more. Sadly, we are abandoning the field of free and fair trade, and it will come back to haunt us. (Applause.)\nWe must not allow the chance to attain energy independence to slip from our grasp. We are blessed with a gift of oil and gas resources here in North America, and we must develop them. We can develop them sensitively, we can develop them, securing our environment, but we must develop them. (Cheers, applause.) And we have the ingenuity to develop alternative sources of energy, too.\nBut most importantly, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will rebuild the foundation of our strength, the American economy, stimulating private sector growth and stimulating small-business entrepreneurship.\n(Cheers, applause.) When the world looks at us today, they see an American government that cannot live within its means. They see an American government that continues to borrow money that will mortgage the future of generations to come. The world knows that when a nation loses control of its finances, it eventually loses control of its destiny. That is not the America that has inspired people to follow our lead. (Applause.)\nAfter all, when the world looks to â€”Â (audio break) â€”Â we are the most successful economic and political experiment in human history. That is the true basis of American exceptionalism. You see, the essence of America, what really unites us, is not nationality or ethnicity or religion. It is an idea. And what an idea it is, that you can come from humble circumstances and you can do great things, that it does not matter where you came from; it matters where you are going. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy fellow Americans, ours has never been a narrative of grievance and entitlement. We have never believed that I am doing poorly because you are doing well. We have never been jealous of one another and never envious of each other's successes.\n(Cheers, applause.) No, ours has been a belief in opportunity, and it has been a constant struggle, long and hard, up and down, to try to extend the benefits of the American dream to all.\nBut that American ideal is indeed in danger today. There is no country, no, not even a rising China, that can do more harm to us than we can do to ourselves if we do not do the hard work before us here at home. (Cheers, applause.)\nMore than at any other time in history, greatness is built on mobilizing human potential and ambition. We have always done that better than any country in the world. People have come here from all over because they have believed our creed of opportunity and limitless horizons. They have come here from the world's most impoverished nations just to make a decent wage. And they have come here from advanced societies as engineers and scientists to fuel the knowledge- based revolution in the Silicon Valley of California â€”Â (cheers) â€”Â in the Research Triangle of North Carolina â€”Â (cheers, applause) â€”Â along Route 128 in Massachusetts, in Austin, Texas, and across this great land. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe must continue to welcome the world's most ambitious people to be a part of us. In that way we stay young and optimistic and determined. We need immigration laws that protect our borders, meet our economic needs and yet show that we are a compassionate nation of immigrants. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe have been successful, too, because Americans have known that one's status of birth is not a permanent condition. Americans have believed that you might not be able to control your circumstances, but you can control your response to your circumstances. (Cheers, applause.) And your greatest ally in controlling your response to your circumstances has been a quality education. (Applause.) But today, today when I can look at your ZIP code and I can tell whether you're going to get a good education, can I honestly say it doesn't matter where you came from; it matters where you're going? The crisis in K-12 education is a threat to the very fabric of who we are. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy mom was a teacher. I respect the profession. We need great teachers, not poor ones and not mediocre ones. We have to have high standards for our kids because self-esteem comes from achievement, not from lax standards and false praise. (Cheers, applause.) And we need to give parents greater choice â€”Â particularly, particularly poor parents, whose kids, very often minorities, are trapped in failing neighborhood schools. (Applause.)\nThis is the civil rights issue of our day. (Cheers, applause.)\nIf we do anything less, we condemn generations to joblessness and hopefulness and life on the government dole. If we do anything less, we will endanger our global imperative for competitiveness. And if we do anything less, we will tear apart the fabric of who we are and cement the turn toward entitlement and grievance.\nMitt Romney â€”Â (applause) â€”Â Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will rebuild us at home, and they will help us lead abroad. They will provide an answer to the question, where does America stand?\nThe challenge is real, and the times are hard, but America has met and overcome hard challenges before. Whenever you find yourself doubting us, just think about all those times that America made the impossible seem inevitable in retrospect: our revolutionary founding against the greatest military power of the time; a Civil War, brother against brother, hundreds of thousands dead on both sides, but we emerged a more perfect union; a second founding when impatient patriots were determined to overcome the birth defect of slavery and the scourge of segregation; a long struggle against communism, with the Soviet Union eventually in collapse and Europe whole, free and at peace; and in the aftermath of 9/11, the willingness to take really hard, hard decisions that secured us and prevented the follow-on attack that everybody thought preordained.\nAnd on a personal note â€”Â (cheers, applause) â€”Â and on a personal note, a little girl grows up in Jim Crow Birmingham, the segregated city of the South where her parents can't take her to a movie theater or to a restaurant, but they have her absolutely convinced that even if she can't have a hamburger at the Woolworth's lunch counter, she could be president of the United States if she wanted to be, and she becomes the secretary of state. (Cheers, applause.)\nYes, America has a way of making the impossible seem inevitable in retrospect. But we know it was never inevitable. It took leadership, and it took courage, and it took belief in our values. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have the integrity and the experience and the vision to lead us. They know who we are. They know who we want to be. They know who we are in the world and what we offer.\nThat is why â€”Â that is why this is a moment and an election of consequence, because it just has to be that the freest and most compassionate country on the face of the earth will continue to be the most powerful and a beacon for prosperity and liberty across the world.\nGod bless you, and God bless this extraordinary country, this exceptional country, the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nMIKE HUCKABEE: Thank you. Thank you very much. I was so very honored to be asked to address one of this week's themes: We can do better. And then I was backstage and I heard some folks say that after hearing me speak, the delegates are going to say: We sure can do better than Huckabee. (Laughter.) And that's when they will unanimously nominate Mitt Romney to be the next president of the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)\nI want to say that Tampa has been a wonderful and hospitable city, and I'm grateful for all that they've done for us. But the only hitch in an otherwise perfect week was the awful noise coming from the hotel room next door to mine. Turns out, it was just Debbie Wasserman Schultz practicing her speech for the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte next week, bless her heart.\n(Mixed cheers and boos, applause.)\nFour years ago Mitt Romney and I were opponents. We still are. (Chuckles.) But we're not opposing each other. No, we are mutual opponents of the miserably failed experiments that have put this country in a downward spiral. The United States of America was originally an experiment. But it was an experiment in recognizing God-given individual liberty and creating a government in which no one is deemed better than another and in which all of us are equal, not equal in abilities but equal in intrinsic worth and value. It is the essence not just of who we are but what we are.\nNow, let me just say, to those who question how once-rivals can be now united, it's quite simple. We have Barack Obama to thank. (Cheers, applause.) It was Barack Obama who said, you didn't build it. Translation: It doesn't belong to you. (Cheers, applause.) Well, no small differences among us in our party approximate the vast differences between the liberty-limiting, radical left-wing, anti- business, reckless-spending, tax-hiking party of Barack Obama, Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi versus an energized America who knows we can do better. (Cheers, applause.)\nFor four years we've given a chance to a man with very limited experience in governing, no experience in business whatsoever and, since taking office, mostly in â€”Â interested in campaigning, blaming and aiming excuses at his predecessor, the Republicans and people in business or, as Republicans like to call them, employers.\nWe've stagnated into an economy that has taken all that hope right down the slope and left millions without jobs, forced out of their homes by foreclosure, herded into dependency upon a government that promises us candy but gives us cavities.\nBarack Obama seems intent on enrolling more people on food stamps. Mitt Romney's focus is going to be on generating more jobs that will make food stamps unnecessary for them. (Cheers, applause.) We know full well we can do better. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt Romney turned around companies that were on the skids. He turned around a scandal-ridden Olympics that was deep in the red, into high point of profit and patriotic pride. And he turned around a very liberal state when he erased a deficit and replaced it with a surplus.\nDo you remember when Barack Obama said that if couldn't turn things around in three years, it would be a one-term proposition? (Cheers, applause.) Well, it's been almost four years. I say let's make him a proposition he can't refuse. Let's vote him out. (Cheers, applause.)\nI understand that the job of president is admittedly tougher than running a company, an Olympic contest or a commonwealth. But when one sees what even Bill Clinton noted was a sterling record of problem- solving that has marked the life of Mitt Romney, we are confident that we will do better.\n(Cheers, applause.) I am thrilled to say Mitt Romney has been loyal to his lovely wife, who knocked it out of the park last night in this arena. (Cheers, applause.) He â€”Â he's been loyal to his sons, to his country, to his employees and to his church.\nWell, I'm sure now that the press is going to tell you he isn't perfect. But my friends, for the past four years, we tried the one that the press thought was perfect, and that hasn't worked out all that well for us. (Cheers, applause.) That's why tonight I tell you â€”Â (chuckles) â€”Â we can do better.\nOur Founding Fathers left taxation and tyranny, seeking religious liberty and a society of meritocracy rather than aristocracy. What they created was a bold experiment in government, believing that God gave us unalienable rights and that the role of government is simply to make sure that those rights are protected.\nSo fearful were they that the government would grow beyond their intention that even after crafting our magnificent Constitution, they said, we can do even better. They added amendments. We call them the Bill of Rights. Those Bill of Rights limit what the government can do, and they guarantee what we the people have the unimpeded right to do, whether to speak, assemble, worship, pray, publish or even refuse intrusions into our homes.\nMany of those founders died to pass on that heritage. They had lived under the boot of big government. And what they said was: We can do better. (Cheers, applause.)\nAs a kid growing up in a household, my dad never finished high school. I grew up in a family in which no male upstream from me had ever finished high school, much less gone to college. But I was taught that even though there was nothing I could do about what was behind me, I could change everything about what was in front of me.\nMy working-poor parents told me that I could do better. They taught me I was as good as anybody else. And it never occurred to them to tell me that I could just rest comfortably and wait for good old \"Uncle Sugar\" to feed me, lead me and then bleed me. (Cheers, applause.) They told me to get off my backside, work hard, take risks and treat people honestly and honorably.\nAnd look at me today. I've become, as the press like to label me, a failed candidate. Oh, it's true. I have fallen from the high perch of politics and now I wallow in the mud of the media. (Soft laughter.) But I still know that as a country, we can do better. And with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, we will do better. (Cheers, applause.)\nI want to clear the air about something that has been said. People wonder whether guys like me, an evangelical, would only support a fellow evangelical. Well, my friends, I want to tell you something. Of the four people on the two tickets, the only self-professed evangelical is Barack Obama, and he supports changing the definition of marriage, believes that human life is disposable and expendable at any time in the womb, even beyond the womb, and he tells people of faith that they have to bow their knees to the god of government and violate their faith and conscience in order to comply with what he calls health care.\nFriends, I know we can do better. (Cheers, applause.)\nLet me say it as clearly as possible that the attack on my Catholic brothers and sisters is an attack on me. (Cheers, applause.) The Democrats have brought back that old dance, the limbo, to see how low they can go in attempting to limit our ability to practice our faith. But this isn't a battle about contraceptives and Catholics but about conscience and the Creator.\nLet me say to you tonight I care far less as to where Mitt Romney takes his family to church than I do about where he takes this country. (Cheers, applause.)\nJoe Biden â€”Â Joe Biden said, show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value. Well, in the Senate, Joe's party hasn't produced a budget in three years. What does that say â€”Â (chuckles) â€”Â about their values?\nAnd by the way, speaking of budgets, Joe Biden's budget shows that while he wants to be very generous with your money through higher taxes and government spending, for years he gave less than two-tenths of 1 percent of his own money to charity.\nHe just wants you to give the government more so he and the Democrats can feel better about themselves. Mitt Romney has given over 16 percent of his income to church and charity. (Cheers, applause.) And my friends, I feel a lot better about having a president who will give generously of his own money instead of mine or yours. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy concern is not Barack Obama's past, but my concern is for the future â€”Â not his future, but for the future of my grandchildren, little Chandler and Scarlett. And under this president, we have burdened each of them with tens of thousands of dollars of debt and a system that will collapse upon itself because he thinks that we can prosper by punishing productivity and rewarding reckless irresponsibility.\nThe Democrats say we ought to give Barack Obama credit for trying. Folks, that sounds like the nonsense of giving every kid a trophy for showing up. (Cheers, applause.) Let's be clear: We're talking about leading the country, not playing on a third-grade soccer team. Look, I realize this is a man who got a Nobel Peace Prize for what he would potentially do. But in the real world, you get the prize for producing something, not just promising something. (Cheers, applause.) Sometimes we get so close to the picture we really can't see it clearly.\nI've had the privilege of working with Bono for the past few years in the ONE campaign to fight AIDS and hunger and disease around the world.\nBono is an Irishman and a great humanitarian, and I remember him telling me of his admiration for America. He said, America is more than just a country. We are an idea. And he reminded me that we are an exceptional nation with an extraordinary history who owes it to the generations who are coming after us to leave them with an extraordinary legacy. But if we don't change the direction of our nation now, our bequest will be nothing but an extraordinary chain. But dear friends, we can do better. (Cheers, applause.)\nPresident Obama is out of gas, and Americans are out of patience. And our great republic is almost out of time. It's time that we no longer lead from behind, but that we get off our behinds and leave something lasting for those who came after us instead of a mountain of debt and a pile of excuses. Tonight â€”Â not because we're Republicans â€”Â it's because we are Americans that we proudly stand with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, and we say, we will do better. (Cheers, applause.)\nGod bless you. Thank you. God bless. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nTIM PAWLENTY: Thank you. Thank you very much. Good evening, everyone, and welcome to Barack Obama's retirement party. (Cheers, applause.)\nFour years ago we came together for this convention back in my home state of Minnesota. (Cheers, applause.) And a lot's happened since then. We've had four years of Barack Obama in the White House. Ah, the Obama White House. One bad decision follows another.\nIt's hard to say exactly just what his worst mistake has been. There's so many to choose from: the stimulus, his energy policy, \"Obamacare,\" taxes, Joe Biden. (Laughter.)\nNow, I hear Joe's particularly interested in tonight's proceedings. He even thought about coming here to Tampa, and he's taking notes, because when Paul Ryan speaks, Joe will finally get to hear what a real vice president sounds like. (Cheers, applause.)\nBut you know, President Obama isn't as bad as people say. He's actually worse. (Laughter, applause.) The president takes more vacations than that guy on the Bizarre Foods show. (Laughter.) And I'll give Barack Obama credit for creating jobs these last four years â€”Â for golf caddies. (Laughter.) Actually, Barack Obama is the first president to create more excuses than jobs. (Applause.) In his view, it's George's fault; it's the bank's fault; it's Europe's fault; it's the weather's fault; it's Congress' fault. Mr. President, if you want to find fault, I suggest you look in the mirror. (Cheers, applause.)\nI've come to realize that Barack Obama is the \"tattoo president.\" Like a big tattoo, it seemed cool when we were young, but later on that decision doesn't look so good. And you wonder: What was I thinking? (Laughter, cheers, applause.) But the worst part is, you're going to have to explain it to your kids. (Laughter.)\nNext week Barack Obama will plead with America to give his failed policies and ideas another chance. He's asking Americans to give him more time and more money. Well, sorry, Mr. President, but you're out of time, and we're out of money. (Cheers, applause.)\nBarack Obama's failed us. But look, it's understandable. A lot of people fail at their first job. (Laughter, cheers, applause.)\nNow, our opponents claim to be the party of the middle class, but Democrats don't understand this fundamental point: It's really hard for people to be part of the middle class if they don't have a job.\nNow, I know a bit about these things.\nI grew up in a meatpacking town. For much of his life, my dad was a truck driver. My mom was a homemaker. She died when I was 16 years old, and my dad lost his job not long after that. I was the only one of five kids in our family who had a chance to go to college.\nWhen I traveled the country these past few years, I met Americans from all different walks of life. If you ask middle-class Americans about their hopes and their dreams, they'll share their heart but also their concerns. Can they pay the mortgage? Will they have enough money to buy groceries or put gas in the car? Will they be able to get their kids into college or pay the tuition?\nBut jobs don't come from politicians. They come from the entrepreneurs, the inventors, the innovators and the risk-takers. (Cheers, applause.) America's entrepreneurs know taxes are too high and regulations are too costly and complex. \"Obamacare\" frightens them, and they want more American energy. And they're collectively making one common plea. They're saying, I want to grow my business and employ people, but they're also saying this: Just get the government off my back. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe need to let them know that help's on the way. And help's name is Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nLadies and gentlemen, we have the best candidate. This isn't his first job or the first time he's been a leader who's produced results. He's made a success of failing companies. He made a success of the Olympics. He even made government in Massachusetts more effective and efficient. And now he's ready to help get America back on track and Americans back to work. (Cheers, applause.) He has a plan to strengthen and grow America's middle class with lower taxes, a government that works for the American people instead of dashing their hopes and dreams, lowering energy prices and greater access to quality education for all.\nBut there's one other thing that I want to leave you with tonight. It's important for America to know that Mitt Romney is not only a great leader; he's also a remarkable person. (Cheers, applause.) He's smart, gracious and wise. And he has this infectious good cheer about him, something I appreciate and something America needs. Mitt Romney never quits moving. When he sees a problem, he goes after it and finds the solution. It's that can-do spirit, combined with a lifetime of service and success, that convinced me to support him. And it's that can-do spirit that we need in the White House leading America now. (Applause.)\nAs a former governor, I know that leadership takes optimism, but not blind optimism. We need a leader who understands the depth of our challenges but who also doesn't shy away from them.\nMitt Romney knows what our problems are, and he has the tools and the experience and the energy and the right policies to fix them. (Cheers, applause.)\nAfter four years of this president, we need Mitt Romney now more than ever. (Cheers, applause.)\nI'm proud to be supporting him for president of the United States, and I know you are too. And with any luck, in a few months, Barack Obama will at last get some experience in the private sector. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Good night. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nLUIS FORTUNO: Thank you. Thank you very much. Buenas noches, Puerto Rico. (Cheers, applause.) Buenas noches, Florida. Buenas noches, America.\nAs a proud American serving the nearly 4 million American citizens of Puerto Rico, I'm honored to be with you tonight. We gather to celebrate the hopes and dreams of every American. We all believe in the greatness of this nation. And this greatness lies within each of us.\nHardworking Americans are fighting every day to provide for themselves and their families and leave a more prosperous country for the next generation. That is true here in Florida, it is true in Puerto Rico, and it is true throughout this great land of ours.\nBut as families have tightened their budgets, Washington continues its wasteful spending.\nUnless we elect leaders who take responsibility now, our children and theirs will pay for it later. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou and I know there is a better way, and like many conservative governors around the country, we are proving it. When I took office, I inherited a $3.3 billion budget deficit, per person the largest anywhere in this nation. We could not even meet our payroll. We were on the brink of bankruptcy.\nBut we did not shy away from our responsibility to lead. We cut government expenses by almost 20 percent, starting with my own salary. We reduced our deficit 90 percent while continuing to invest in our schools, hospitals and highways. At the same time, we slashed taxes 50 percent on individuals and 30 percent on businesses, the largest tax cut in Puerto Rico history. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd guess what? Our private sector, the real economy, began to create jobs again. Imagine if we had national policies that support rather than prevent growth. We'd then be able to truly unleash the engine of prosperity that our country and our people deserve. That's what Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will do for America. (Cheers, applause.) They understand that each community's challenges are unique, but the answers are the same.\nOur families cannot grow their budgets if politicians keep growing Washington's budget. We need to get government out of our way. (Cheers, applause.) And we need to let freedom and the spirit of the American people shine through. We can outthink, out-dream, out-work and outproduce anybody in the world.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah!\nLUIS FORTUNO: I know it, you know it, and Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan certainly know it. (Cheers, applause.) They have a plan and a vision that places our faith in you, the American people, not in Washington. (Cheers, applause.) Ask any small-business owner in America today, from the dairy farmer in Appleton, Wisconsin, to the bodega owner in Kissimmee, Florida. They want to grow, to produce and to hire. But they are concerned, worried that Washington will continue to punish them with more taxes, more red tape and more government control. Give them the freedom to grow, and you'll see how many jobs they create. (Cheers, applause.)\nI like to talk a lot about freedom because freedom is the essence of who we are as Americans. Over 200,000 Puerto Ricans have served in uniform â€”Â (cheers, applause) â€”Â to defend our nation and the freedom we hold so dear. Like in your home states, we raise and salute the American flag. Just like our fellow citizens in Florida or Virginia, we share the same undying spirit that all Americans have.\nAllow me to share an example of that spirit. I visited a soldier from Puerto Rico at Walter Reed Army Medical Center several years ago. This young man had bravely served in combat and was given little chance to live. Without knowing if he could hear me, in every visit I would whisper into his ear. I would tell him how proud and thankful we were for his dedication and sacrifice, adding, \"No te rindas,\" \"Don't give up.\" (Cheers, applause.)\nMonths later, after his miraculous recovery, I had the honor of awarding the Purple Heart. He never gave up. (Cheers, applause.)\nFor him and for every American in uniform, we will never give up.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) (Inaudible.)\nLUIS FORTUNO: For every mother who struggles, saves and sacrifices so her children will have greater opportunities, we will never give up.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) (Inaudible.) (Applause.)\nLUIS FORTUNO: For every small-business owner who builds it to make a better life, we will never give up.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) (Inaudible.) (Applause.)\nLUIS FORTUNO: For Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, who know what it takes to put America back to work and back on track, we will never give up.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Inaudible) â€”Â up.\nLUIS FORTUNO: And for the values â€”Â the values that make America great, the justice that is our right, the freedom to unleash the greatness within each of us and the liberty that God endowed every American â€”Â for that, I will never give up.\nYou will never give up. We will never give up.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: We will never give up!\nLUIS FORTUNO: God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.) Muchas gracias, Puerto Rico. See you tomorrow! Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nSTEVE COHEN: Good evening. My name is Steven Cohen, and I am president of Screen Machine Industries, a family-owned manufacturer of construction and mining equipment located in the great Buckeye State of Ohio. (Cheers, applause.) And yes, we did build this company. (Cheers, applause.) Our country's nearly 30 million small businesses serve as the American backbone for job creation and product innovation. The opportunity to create new products and open new markets is the American dream. This capitalistic spirit has supported our economy since its founding.\nAs a manufacturer, our products are the heartbeats of our business. We can't tolerate other companies stealing hard work without compensation. It can take several years and tens of thousands of dollars to achieve patent status. Once granted, we expect it to be protected.\nOur products are often stolen and copied overseas for a mere fraction of the price. All too often tariffs and unfair trade practices make it difficult for American businesses to export. We need a president that will protect America's patented inventions, guard the value of our currency and open up new markets for American products. (Cheers, applause.)\nAmerican small businesses face a mountain of regulations and taxes. In addition, our international competitors do not have to face the upcoming costs associated with funding a multi-billion-dollar health care plan, overreaching emissions standards and the unnecessary war on coal. These factors create a tremendous disadvantage in the global marketplace. We need an administration that will lessen tax burdens and government regulations that strangle small businesses.\nWhile we face higher government-imposed costs, cheaper imports from overseas companies flood our markets. Unnecessary regulations and mandates imposed on business make our products more expensive to make and less competitive to sell. We need a Romney administration to ensure our country's competitiveness and give our companies the opportunities to expand and hire again. (Cheers, applause.) Let's bring back that original American will to invent, employ and prosper! Thank you.",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nMS. : Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Yohana de la Torre live from backstage in the Republican National Convention. And today I have the honor to be with Michigan delegate Michelle Voorheis. Welcome, Michelle. (Cheers.)\nMICHELLE VOORHEIS: Hi, Yohana. It's great to be here tonight.\nMS. : Michelle, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself?\nMICHELLE VOORHEIS: Well, I'm a wife and a mom, and I come from the small town of Clio, Michigan. (Cheers, applause.) And I'm a small- business owner.\nMS. : I understand that you have a commercial real estate business. How has your business fared under President Obama?'\nMICHELLE VOORHEIS: Well, first let me say that Obama did not build my business. (Cheers, applause.) But he is doing everything in his power to tear it down. Under his administration, the regulations and restrictions that he is placing on the banks have caused them to stop lending money. So even though my husband and I have excellent credit and we've never missed a payment, we're unsure whether we're going to be able to get the financing to continue funding our business.\nThis creates uncertainty for us, so we aren't hiring any employees. This makes for 12- to 14-hour days that we have to work to keep our business running. I have an 18-year-old son that I just sent off to college and a 90-year-old mother-in-law that we are caring for, and I don't see any end in sight if something doesn't change soon.\nMS. : What does your future look like for you?\nMICHELLE VOORHEIS: Well, first I want to say that we give thanks to God for everything that we have. My husband and I have been married for 35 years, and during that time, we have worked hard, we've played by the rules, we've done everything right. So we thought at the end of the day we were going to have a great retirement and we were going to have a successful business that we could leave to our kids. But right now, I don't know if I'm ever going to get to retire. I'm 55. I don't want to start over again and do something else. So under the Obama administration, I feel that our dreams are slipping away.\nMS. : Michelle's story is just one of the many of small- business owners and what they're going through today during the President Obama's administration.\nNow we go back live to the Republican National Convention. I'm Yohana de la Torre. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nROB PORTMAN: Thank you. Thank you. (Chuckles.) Thank you. Good evening, America! (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd hello to the fired-up delegation from the Buckeye State right there in front of me. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy name is Rob Portman, and they say I was on Governor Romney's short list of vice presidential candidates. Apparently, it wasn't short enough. (Scattered laughter.) What a great convention. And I'm delighted to be here tonight to talk about the fundamental differences between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama when it comes to understanding our economy.\nLet's begin by talking about something the Democrats love to demonize: Mitt Romney's success in the private sector. He built a company from the ground up, created lots of jobs, and yes, he made money. (Cheers, applause.) He made it the old-fashioned way, folks: He earned it. (Cheers, applause.)\nThen you have Barack Obama, who never started a business, never even worked in business, and yet he claims those who have should give credit to the government or someone else for their success. (Boos.)\nSo you have one candidate who understands that success comes from working hard, competing and taking risks. And you have another candidate who believes that success comes from government. (Boos.) Let me ask you this: Which one do you think knows how to turn around this economy? (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) Romney! Romney!\nROB PORTMAN: Right answer. Let me ask you this: Which one would you choose to invest your life savings?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney!\nROB PORTMAN: Should it be any different for safeguarding our nation's economy?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nROB PORTMAN: Or let's say you don't have any savings. Let's say you're worried about how to pay September's rent or mortgage. Let's say you're one of the millions of Americans out of work or millions more who have given up looking for work. You've got to be running out of patience and hope. You've got to be tired, looking for a new start. Well, you don't have to be patient any longer. Through your vote this fall, you can change the leadership of this country and the opportunities for you and your families. (Cheers, applause.)\nAmerica, it's been nearly four years of 8 percent unemployment â€”Â double-digit unemployment for young people, Hispanics, African Americans. Four years. FDR and Truman won an entire world war in four years. America is tired of waiting. (Cheers, applause.) Listen, in business if you don't move rapidly, what happens? You're out of business; you're finished. We want a president who operates at business speed, not government speed. (Cheers, applause.)\nPresident Obama says that he deserves re-election because his economic policies have worked. Not in this universe, they haven't. (Cheers, boos, applause.) In fact, the experts tell us that if we don't change our policies, we're going back into recession next year. Folks, tens of millions of Americans are not out of the last recession. Governor Romney had a plan to build his business.\nHe now has a detailed plan to restore our economy and strengthen the middle class. (Cheers, applause.) I ask you, where's the president's economic plan? Blaming others does not qualify as a plan.\nNow, the president did submit a budget. It was so bad, folks, that not a â€”Â (audio break) â€”Â Republican or a single Democrat in the entire United States Congress would vote for it. He got zero votes. That is a failure of leadership. (Cheers, applause.)\nPresident Obama has been right about at least one prediction he's made about the economy. He said: If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition. (Cheers, applause.)\nI think you're right about that, Mr. President. It hasn't worked because you cannot spend your way, regulate your way, tax your way or blame your way out of the economic mess that we're in. (Cheers, applause.) You have to liberate the productive power of the American people through policies that encourage innovation, risk-taking, investment and jobs. And you have to compete and win in the global economy. Governor Romney understands this. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn contrast, President Obama is the first president in 75 years â€”Â Democrat or Republican â€”Â who hasn't even sought the ability to negotiate export agreements and open markets overseas.\nNow why is this important? Because 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside of our borders, and to create jobs, our workers and our farmers need to sell more of what we make to those people. (Cheers, applause.)\nWhile this administration has been dragging its feet, other countries have been busy negotiating hundreds of new trade agreements to benefit their workers, their farmers, taking away our opportunities. President Obama has been so driven to advance his big- government ideology that he has abandoned the daily work that a government must do to open markets, restore business confidence and create the climate for job growth. This is the work President Romney would begin on day one. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) (Inaudible.)\nROB PORTMAN: Take trade with China. China manipulates its currency, giving it an unfair trade advantage. So why doesn't the president do something about it? I'll tell you one reason. President Obama could not run up his record trillion-dollar deficit if the Chinese didn't buy our bonds to finance them. Folks, we are as beholden to China for bonds as we are to the Middle East for oil. This will end under Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe need to knock down these barriers to trade abroad, but we also need to knock down self-imposed barriers to success right here at home. We need to reform our outdated and complicated tax code. We need to fix our burdensome regulatory system. And we need an energy policy that encourages the development of our resources right here, in the ground, in America.\n(Cheers, applause.) America has a choice between Mitt Romney, who seeks to grow the economy, and Barack Obama, who seeks to redistribute it. Which one do you think will liberate America's entrepreneurial spirit?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney!\nROB PORTMAN: At the other party's convention, you're going to hear another chant. Their chant will be, \"Four more years, four more years.\" Folks, we cannot afford four more years. (Cheers, applause.) How about no more years? (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) No more years! No more years! No more years! No more years! No more years! No more years! No more years! No more years!\nROB PORTMAN: Governor Romney â€”Â Governor Romney chose a terrific partner in Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. (Cheers, applause.) Paul's a close friend, a great family man, and he's got a reformer's heart.\nContrast this to Joe Biden. Vice President Biden has told people out of work to, quote, just hang in there. So much for hope and change. Paul Ryan is not asking America to continue to hang in there. He's proposing new policies that will give poor and middle-class families opportunities and hope for the future. (Cheers, applause.) Mitt Romney made his mark turning around businesses, solving problems. Paul Ryan made his mark as a respected reformer focused on results.\nTogether, they will do what President Obama has not done: They will lead in breaking through the partisan gridlock in Washington, D.C. (Cheers, applause.) America, give them the chance to restore America's economy and restore the American dream.\nI've seen that dream up close. When I was a kid, my dad left his job as a salesman for a big company and started his own business, taking a risk. He sold forklift trucks. My mom was the bookkeeper. She had to borrow money â€”Â they had to borrow money from her uncle because the bank wouldn't give him a loan. He lost money the first few years, but he never lost his dream. By the time he retired and my brother took over, the business had 200 employees. Two hundred families in southwest Ohio were supported by that business.\nThis is the classic American story not of government telling us what to do but of free men and free women willing to work hard and take a risk to build something of value for themselves, their families and their community. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nROB PORTMAN: About a year into the Obama administration, I asked my dad whether he would do it again. He said, Rob, with all the uncertainty out there today, I don't know if I would take the risk. In that one sentence, folks, he summed up what I've heard from hundreds of small-business owners all across Ohio and around this great country. They're afraid to make the investment, and jobs are the casualty. (Applause.)\nLadies and gentlemen, we need new leadership and new policies to bring back the dream and renew America's promise. (Cheers, applause.)\nNo more excuses, no more blaming others, no more waiting. We need Romney-Ryan, and we need them now. (Cheers, applause.) And with your help, it's going to happen. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you, and God bless our great country. (Cheers, applause.)",
        "(Cheers, applause.)\nTAD TRUE: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, energy powers everything we do, and America depends on reliable and affordable energy. This is a simple concept, but the Obama administration does not get it. His policies are driving us away from energy independence, not towards it.\nMitt Romney knows that we need an all-of-the-above energy policy that includes oil, gas and coal and renewables like wind and solar so that we can finally secure energy independence for our country. Infrastructure is fundamental to all energy systems, and infrastructure is critical to achieving energy independence, infrastructure like pipelines, which prompts me to ask, Mr. President, where is the Keystone pipeline? (Cheers, applause.)\nI am part of the third generation of a family-owned businesses, and we operate pipelines in the great states of Wyoming, North Dakota and Montana.\nThese companies were started by my grandfather and then run by my father and uncles. Between them and our 152 dedicated and incredibly talented employees, we built almost 4,000 miles of pipeline. (Cheers, applause.) A lot of our recent work has been constructing new pipeline infrastructure in western North Dakota to support the development of the Bakken oil shale, an exciting and an important development for America.\nSome time ago we agreed to build the on ramp the Keystone XL pipeline, so that it could take American-produced oil to American markets. (Cheers.) If Keystone had received timely approval of their permit, it would be under construction today. Instead Americans have missed out on jobs from this pipeline because the Obama administration has played politics with the Keystone project.\nMy hope is that my three boys, Henry, Sam and Charlie, will be part of the fourth generation of our family business. (Cheers.) And although my kids think pipelines are boring, I know and you know and Mitt Romney knows that pipelines are vital to America's energy system. (Cheers, applause.)\nLadies and gentlemen, this is not about just one pipeline. This is about a fundamental transformation of America's energy system so that we can achieve that long sought-after goal of energy independence. (Applause.)\nMore importantly, it's about my three boys and your children and about rebuilding a nation that can once again power itself.\n(Cheers, applause.) We need a president that understands that we need all of that energy, all of that oil, all of those jobs. And we need a president that understands that America needs that pipeline. That president is Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.",
